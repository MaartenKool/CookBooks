      "general questions and answers blanket cancellation of orders policy updated 30 may 2017 q4 1 is a policy pursuant to which after becoming in possession of inside information the person should immediately and without the exercise of discretion cancel all orders relating to that information blanket order cancellation policy compliant with the insider dealing prohibition under mar\n",
      "a4 1 article 8 1 of mar states that the use of inside information by cancelling or amending an order placed before the person concerned possessed inside information constitutes insider dealing\n",
      "this presumption is rebuttable under recital 25 of mar if the person establishes that they did not use the inside information when carrying out the transaction\n",
      "it follows that where a firm decides to adopt a blanket cancellation policy for its proprietary trading the fact that the cancellation may or may not constitute insider dealing will have to be assessed on case by case basis by determining whether or not the cancellation was indeed performed without using the inside information\n",
      "questions and answers on the disclosure of inside information disclosure of inside information related to pillar ii requirements updated 23 march 2018 10 q5 1 are credit institutions required under mar to publish systematically the results of the pillar ii assessment and or any information received in relation to the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities mrel exercise\n",
      "issuers who have requested or approved admission of their financial instruments to trading on a regulated market or in the case of instruments only traded on an mtf or on an otf issuers who have approved trading of their financial instruments on an mtf or an otf or have requested their admission to trading on an mtf must inform the public as soon as possible of any inside information relating directly to them\n",
      "according to article 7 of mar inside information is such information that is non public precise and if it were made public would be likely to have a significant effect on the price of the issuer s financial instrument or related financial instruments\n",
      "mar offers by way of exception to the immediate disclosure of inside information the possibility on a case by case basis to delay such disclosure under certain conditions\n",
      "in accordance with article 17 4 of mar any issuer may thus delay under its own responsibility the public disclosure of inside information such as not to prejudice its legitimate interests provided that such omission is not likely to mislead the public16 and the issuer is able to ensure the confidentiality of the information\n",
      "where the issuer is also a credit or financial institution article 17 5 of mar allows for another possibility to delay in exceptional circumstances the public disclosure of inside information under the issuer s responsibility in order to preserve the stability of the financial system\n",
      "where such an issuer intends to delayunder article 17 5 of mar it needs the prior consent of the competent authority on the basis that the following conditions are fulfilled i the disclosure of the inside information entails a risk of undermining the financial stability of the issuer and of the financial system ii it is in the public interest to delay disclosure and iii the confidentiality of the information can be ensured\n",
      "however it is not feasible to define ex ante in a general manner how the relevant conditions should be met and therefore the concerned issuer needs to assess on a case by case basis the particular circumstances before deciding to delay the disclosure of inside information under article 17 4 of mar or notifying to the competent authority its intention to delay under article 17 5 of mar\n",
      "under mar an issuer can also be liable for market manipulation in case of dissemination of false and misleading information including failure to properly disclose inside information to the public\n",
      "11 many credit institutions across the european union are issuers of financial instruments and thus subject to the regime established under mar when at the same time they are also subject to the prudential supervision of the banking regulators\n",
      "consequently in the context of the supervisory review and evaluation process srep to be conducted in accordance with article 97 of directive 2013 36 eu crd iv whenever a credit institution subject to the market abuse regime is made aware of information notably the results of the exercise it is expected to evaluate whether that information meets the criteria of inside information\n",
      "along the same line in the context of the mrel exercise to be conducted by the single resolution board in accordance with the bank recovery and resolution directive whenever a credit institution subject to the market abuse regime is made aware of information it is expected to evaluate whether that information meets the criteria of inside information\n",
      "such a credit institution would have then to publicly disclose the inside information as soon as possible unless it has delayed such a disclosure after having assessed that all the conditions for delaying apply\n",
      "esma recalls that if and when a publication e g an article published in the press or internet postings which is not resulting from the issuer s initiative in relation to its disclosure obligations or a rumour in the market relates explicitly to a piece of information that is inside information within the issuer according to article 17 7 of mar that issuer is expected to react and respond to the relevant publication or rumour if that piece of information is sufficiently accurate to indicate that the confidentiality of this inside information is no longer ensured\n",
      "in such circumstances which should be the exception rather than the rule and should be examined by the issuer on a case by case basis a policy of staying silent or of no comment by the issuer would not be acceptable\n",

      "article 11 1 of mar concerns market soundings that gauge the interest of potential investors in a possible transaction in a financial instrument and the conditions relating to it such as its potential size or pricing\n",
      "those financial instruments have to be financial instruments covered by the mar scope as specified in article 2 1 of mar a financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market or for which a request for admission to trading on a regulated market has been made b financial instruments traded on an mtf admitted to trading on an mtf or for which a request for admission to trading on an mtf has been made c financial instruments traded on an otf d financial instruments not covered by point a b or c the price or value of which depends on or has an effect on the price or value of a financial instrument referred to in those points including but not limited to credit default swaps and contracts for difference\n",

      "in such a case to determine if article 2 1 d applies the dmp must assess on a case by case basis whether there is any relationship between the price or value of the financial instrument that is the subject of the sounding and any other existing financial instrument falling under article 2 1 a c of mar such as for instance other financial instruments of the issuer in question or of a parent company\n",
      "28 where the dmp assessed that such relationship exists then the financial instrument will be in scope of mar and the related possible transaction will be in scope of the mar market sounding regime\n",
      "if there is uncertainty as to whether there is a price or value relationship such as where there are no data available regarding a new financial instrument in order to receive the protection under article 11 should it be subsequently shown that there was a relationship an appropriate approach would be for the dmp to apply the provisions of article 11 of mar and the relevant delegated and implementing regulations\n",

      "the calculated emissions over a given year y or the rti as of 31 december of a given year y should be assessed against the minimum thresholds of 6 million tonnes a year of equivalent carbon dioxide or the minimum rti threshold of 2 430 mw specified in article 5 1 a and b of the commission delegated regulation eu 2016 522\n",
      "where either of these thresholds is exceeded the market participant will be deemed to be an emission allowance market participant eamp as defined in article 3 20 of mar as of 1 may of the following year y 1 and thus subject to the obligations applicable to eamps under mar including the requirement to disclose inside information concerning emission allowances it or its parent undertaking or related undertakings may hold\n",

General Questions and Answers  \\n \\nBlanket cancellation of orders policy \\nUpdated: 30 May 2017 \\n \\n \\nQ4.1 \\nIs  a  policy  pursuant  to  which,  after  becoming  in  possession  of  inside \\ninformation,  the  person  should  immediately  and  without  the  exercise  of \\ndiscretion  cancel  all  orders  relating  to  that  information  (“blanket  order \\ncancellation policy”) compliant with the insider dealing prohibition under MAR? \\n \\nA4.1 \\n \\n \\n \\nArticle  8(1)  of  MAR  states  that  “the  use  of  inside  information  by  cancelling  or \\namending  an  order  placed  before  the  person  concerned  possessed  inside \\ninformation” constitutes insider dealing. This presumption is rebuttable under Recital \\n25 of MAR if the person establishes that they “did not use the inside information when \\ncarrying out the transaction”. \\nFor those reasons, it cannot be concluded that a blanket order cancellation policy per \\nse constitutes insider dealing.  \\n \\nIt  follows  that  where  a  firm  decides  to  adopt  a  blanket  cancellation  policy  for  its \\nproprietary  trading,  the  fact  that  the  cancellation  may  or  may  not  constitute  insider \\ndealing will have to be assessed on case-by-case basis, by determining whether or \\nnot the cancellation was indeed performed without using the inside information. \\n5.  Questions  and  Answers  on  the  disclosure  of  inside \\ninformation  \\n \\nDisclosure of inside information related to Pillar II requirements \\nUpdated: 23 March 2018 \\n \\n10 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nQ5.1  Are credit institutions required under MAR to publish systematically the results \\nof  the  Pillar  II  assessment  and/or  any  information  received  in  relation  to  the \\nMinimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) exercise? \\n \\nA5.1 \\nA  main  objective  of  the  Market  Abuse  Regulation  (MAR)  is  to  enhance  market \\nintegrity. This is notably achieved through a prompt and fair disclosure of information \\nto the public. \\n \\nFor  issuers  of  financial  instruments,  this  objective  has  been  translated  into  the \\nrequirement  under  Article  17  of  MAR.  Issuers  who  have  requested  or  approved \\nadmission of their financial instruments to trading on a Regulated Market, or in the \\ncase of instruments only traded on an MTF or on an OTF issuers who have approved \\ntrading of their financial instruments on an MTF or an OTF or have requested their \\nadmission to trading on an MTF, must inform the public as soon as possible of any \\ninside  information  relating  directly  to  them.  According  to  Article  7  of  MAR,  inside \\ninformation is such information that is:  \\n \\n-  non-public,  \\n-  precise, and  \\n- \\nif it were made public would be likely to have a significant effect on the \\nprice of the issuer’s financial instrument or related financial instruments.  \\n \\nMAR offers, by way of exception to the immediate disclosure of inside information, \\nthe  possibility  on  a  case-by-case  basis  to  delay  such  disclosure  under  certain \\nconditions. In accordance with Article 17(4) of MAR, any issuer may thus delay, under \\nits  own  responsibility,  the  public  disclosure  of  inside  information  such  as  not  to \\nprejudice its legitimate interests provided that such omission is not likely to mislead \\nthe  public16 and  the  issuer  is  able  to  ensure  the  confidentiality  of  the  information. \\nWhere the issuer is also a credit or financial institution, Article 17(5) of MAR allows \\nfor another possibility to delay in exceptional circumstances,  the public disclosure of \\ninside information, under the issuer’s responsibility, in order to preserve the stability \\nof the financial system. Where such an issuer intends to delayunder Article 17(5) of \\nMAR,  it  needs  the  prior  consent  of  the  competent  authority  on  the  basis  that  the \\nfollowing  conditions  are fulfilled:  i) the  disclosure  of the  inside  information  entails  a \\nrisk of undermining the financial stability of the issuer and of the financial system, ii) it \\nis in the public interest to delay disclosure and iii) the confidentiality of the information \\ncan be ensured.  \\n \\nHowever it is not feasible to define ex-ante, in a general manner, how the relevant \\nconditions should be met and therefore the concerned issuer needs to assess, on a \\ncase-by-case  basis,  the  particular  circumstances  before  deciding  to  delay  the \\ndisclosure  of  inside  information  under  Article  17(4)  of  MAR  or  notifying  to  the \\ncompetent authority its intention to delay under Article 17(5) of MAR.   \\n \\nUnder  MAR,  an  issuer  can  also  be  liable  for  market  manipulation  in  case  of \\ndissemination  of  false  and  misleading  information,  including  failure  to  properly \\ndisclose inside information to the public. \\n \\n                                                \\n16 ESMA issued MAR Guidelines on delay in the disclosure of inside information ( ESMA/2016/1478; 20 October 2016). \\n11 \\n \\n \\n \\nMany  credit  institutions  across  the  European  Union  are  issuers  of  financial \\ninstruments and thus subject to the regime established under MAR, when at the same \\ntime they are also subject to the prudential supervision of the banking regulators.  \\n \\nConsequently,  in  the  context  of  the  Supervisory  Review  and  Evaluation  Process \\n(SREP) to be conducted in accordance with Article 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD \\nIV), whenever a credit institution subject to the market abuse regime is made aware \\nof information, notably the results of the exercise, it is expected to evaluate whether \\nthat information meets the criteria of inside information.  \\n \\nAlong  the  same  line,  in  the  context  of  the  MREL  exercise  to  be  conducted  by  the \\nSingle  Resolution  Board  in  accordance  with  the  Bank  Recovery  and  Resolution \\nDirective, whenever a credit institution subject to the market abuse regime is made \\naware of  information, it is expected to evaluate whether that information meets the \\ncriteria of inside information. \\n \\nIf  these  criteria  are  met,  the  MAR  provisions  apply  with  respect  to  the  relevant \\ndisclosure requirements. Such a credit institution would have then to publicly disclose \\nthe inside information as soon as possible unless it has delayed such a disclosure \\nafter having assessed that all the conditions for delaying apply.  \\n \\nESMA recalls that, if and when a publication (e.g. an article published in the press or \\ninternet  postings)  which  is  not  resulting  from  the  issuer’s  initiative  in  relation  to  its \\ndisclosure  obligations  or  a  rumour  in  the  market  relates  explicitly  to  (a  piece  of) \\ninformation that  is  inside  information  within  the  issuer,  according  to  Article  17(7)  of \\nMAR that issuer is expected to react and respond to the relevant publication or rumour \\nif that (piece of) information is sufficiently accurate to indicate that the confidentiality \\nof this inside information is no longer ensured. In such circumstances, which should \\nbe the exception rather than the rule and should be examined by the issuer on a case-\\nby-case basis, a policy of staying silent or of “no comment” by the issuer would not be \\nacceptable. The issuer’s reaction or response should be made publicly available in \\nthe  same  conditions  and  using  the  same  mechanisms  as  those  used  for  the \\ncommunication  of  inside  information,  so  that  an  ad  hoc  announcement  has  to  be \\npublished without undue delay.  \\n \\nFinally,  it  is  noted  that  the  disclosure  of  inside  information  is  a  matter  of  national \\nsupervision and enforcement  of MAR, solely under the competence of the national \\ncompetent authorities designated to that effect in accordance with Article 22 of MAR \\nand whose heads are members of the Board of Supervisors of ESMA.   \\n \\n \\nDelayed inside information that lost the feature of the price sensitivity \\nUpdated: 29 September 2017 \\n \\n \\nQ5.2  How should an issuer deal with a situation where it has delayed a disclosure of \\ninside  information  in  accordance  with  Article  17(4)  of  MAR  and,  due  to \\nsubsequent  circumstances,  that  information  loses  the  element  of  price \\nsensitivity and therefore its inside nature? \\n \\n12 \\n \\n \\n \\nA5.2 \\nAccording  to  Article  17(1)  of  MAR,  an  issuer  has  to  inform  the  public  as  soon  as \\npossible of inside information that directly concerns that issuer. Article 17(4) of MAR \\nstates  that  an  issuer  may,  on  its  own  responsibility,  delay  disclosure  of  inside \\ninformation to the public, provided that all of the conditions therein contained are met. \\nWhere an issuer has delayed the disclosure of inside information according to Article \\n17(4) of MAR, immediately after the information is disclosed to the public the issuer \\nneeds  to  inform  the  competent  authority  that  disclosure  of  inside  information  was \\ndelayed, and provide written explanation on how the conditions set out in Article 17(4) \\nof MAR were met.  \\n \\nWhere the issuer has delayed the disclosure of inside information in accordance with \\nArticle  17(4)  of  MAR  and  the  information  subsequently  loses  the  element  of  price \\nsensitivity,  that  information  ceases  to  be  inside  information  and  thus  is  considered \\noutside the scope of Article 17(1) of MAR. Therefore, the issuer is neither obliged to \\npublicly disclose that information nor to inform the competent authority in accordance \\nwith  the  last  paragraph  of  Article  17(4)  that  disclosure  of  such  information  was \\ndelayed. \\n \\nHowever, given that the information had been inside information for a certain period \\nof time, the issuer had to comply with all relevant obligations relating to the drawing \\nup and updating of insider lists and the maintenance of the information relating to the \\ndelay  of  disclosure,  stemming  from  MAR  and  its  delegated  and  implementing \\nRegulations. \\n \\n \\nDelayed disclosure of inside information under Article 17(5) of MAR: assessment of the \\nrelevant conditions \\nUpdated: 1 October 2018 (new) \\n \\n \\nQ5.3  When issuers that are credit/financial institutions intend to delay disclosure of \\ninside  information  under  Article  17(5)  of  MAR,  what  are  the  elements  they \\nshould consider in their assessment of the conditions therein contained? \\n \\nA5.3  When a credit/financial institution intends to resort to the financial stability delay under \\nArticle 17(5) of MAR, it should provide evidence to the NCA that the conditions laid \\ndown in points a), b) and c) of the same article are met. \\nThe assessment of those conditions should be as complete as possible to the best of \\nthe credit/financial institution’s knowledge.  \\nIf the NCA gives its consent to the delay further to its own assessment of the relevant \\nconditions,  the  credit/financial  institution  is  expected  to  share  with  the  NCA  any \\nsubsequent additional information relating to the conditions for the delay.  \\n \\nPoint a) of Article 17(5) of MAR: disclosure of inside information entails a risk \\nof undermining the financial stability of the issuer and the financial system \\nIt should be noted that to resort to the delay under Article 17(5) of MAR, disclosure of \\ninside information has to entail a risk of undermining the financial stability of both the \\nissuer and the financial system. \\n13 \\n \\n \\n \\nFor the disclosure of inside information to entail a risk of undermining the stability of \\nthe financial system, it is likely for it to pertain and be performed by an institution of \\nrelevance, e.g. in terms of impact and interconnection.  \\nIn  this  context,  credit/financial  institutions  should  not  simply  rely  on  ex  ante \\ncategorisations but rather look at the specific circumstances. \\n \\nPoint b) of Article 17(5) of MAR: the public interest to delay the disclosure \\nIn  the  absence  of  any  definition  of  “public  interest”,  Recital  52  of  MAR  provides \\nguidance  stipulating  that  “the  wider  public  and  economic  interest  in  delaying \\ndisclosure outweighs the interest of the market in receiving the information which is \\nsubject to delay”. \\nWhen assessing the public interest,  the credit/financial institution should attempt to \\nidentify different entities or groups who could be directly or indirectly affected by the \\ndecision to delay the disclosure of the inside information and whose interests may be \\nunderstood as a public interest.  \\nDuring  the  assessment  of  the  public  interest,  it  is  important  to  consider  interests \\nbeyond the direct economic impacts and other non-financial interests of the public. All \\nof  these  interests  would  need  to  be  considered,  and  none  of  them  should  be \\nconsidered in isolation.   \\nIf  there  are  divergent  interests  of  the  public,  the  credit/financial  institution  should \\nassess  on  a  case-by-case  basis  if  the  prevailing  public  interest(s)  is  to  delay  the \\ndisclosure of inside information. For example, a potential loss to investors who have \\nmade or may make an investment decision should be weighed against the adverse \\neffect of public disclosure on other groups, such as depositors and consumers.  \\n \\nPoint c) of Article 17(5) of MAR: the confidentiality of the information \\nCredit/financial  institutions  should  provide  the  NCA  with  information  on  how  the \\nconfidentiality of the inside information can be ensured.  \\nCredit/financial  institutions  are  expected  to  assess  the  confidentiality  of  the \\ninformation at the time of the notification to the NCA, but also how the confidentiality \\ncan be ensured during the period in which the information might be delayed.  \\nTo  that  purpose,  credit/financial  institutions  should  consider  their  procedures  and \\nmeasures put in place to ensure the confidentiality and draw up their insider list given \\nthat, pending the NCA’s decision to consent to the delay, the disclosure of the inside \\ninformation is de facto already delayed. \\n \\n \\nDelayed disclosure of inside information under Article 17(5) of MAR: notification of the \\nexpected duration \\nUpdated: 1 October 2018 (new) \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\n \\n \\nQ5.4  Are  credit/financial  institutions  required  to  notify  the  NCA  of  the  expected \\nduration of the delay under Article 17(5) of MAR? \\n \\nA5.4 \\nYes. The credit/financial institutions notifying the NCA of their intention to resort to the \\nfinancial  stability  delay  are  expected  to  provide  their  assessment  on  the  expected \\nlength of the delay and the details of expected trigger events.  \\nIf the NCA gives its consent to the delay further to its own assessment of the relevant \\nconditions, credit/financial institutions should inform the NCA whenever they become \\naware of a new element or event that may affect the duration of the delay under Article \\n17(5) of MAR. \\n \\n \\nDelayed  disclosure  of inside information  under  Article  17(5)  of MAR:  NCA’s  denial  of \\nconsent \\nUpdated: 1 October 2018 (new) \\n \\n \\nQ5.5  Where the NCA does not consent to the delay of disclosure under Article 17(5) \\nof MAR, can a credit/financial institution resort to Article 17(4) of MAR? \\n \\nA5.5 \\nNo. Where the relevant conditions are not met, the NCA cannot consent to the delay \\nunder Article 17(5) of MAR and, according to Article 17(6) of MAR, the credit/financial \\ninstitution will have to disclose the inside information immediately. \\nIn  that  case,  credit/financial  institutions  will  not  be  able  to  resort  to  the  delay  of \\ndisclosure under Article 17(4) of MAR.  \\n \\n6.  Questions and Answers on the Prevention and detection \\nof market abuse \\n \\nPersons professionally arranging or executing transactions  \\nUpdated: 1 September 2017 \\n \\n \\nQ6.1  Does  the  obligation  to  detect  and  report  market  abuse  under  Article  16(2)  of \\nMAR  apply  to  investment  firms  under  MiFID  only  or  do  UCITS  management \\ncompanies, AIFMD managers or firms professionally engaged in trading on own \\naccount also fall within the scope of that obligation? \\n \\nA6.1 \\nThe definition of “person professionally arranging or executing transactions” laid down \\nin point (28) of Article 3(1) of MAR is activity based, does not cross refer to definitions \\nunder  MiFID  and  is  independent  from  the  latter,  leading  thus  to  consider  that  the \\nscope  of  Article  16(2)  of  MAR  is  not  only  limited  to  firms  or  entities  providing \\ninvestment services under MiFID.  \\n \\n15 \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the absence of any reference in the definition that would limit the scope and exclude \\nparticular  categories  of  persons  regulated  by  other  financial  European  legislation, \\nESMA considers that the obligation to detect and identify market abuse or attempted \\nmarket abuse under Article 16(2) of MAR applies broadly, and “persons professionally \\narranging or executing transactions” thus includes buy side firms, such as investment \\nmanagement  firms  (AIFs  and  UCITS  managers),  as  well  as  firms  professionally \\nengaged in trading on own account (proprietary traders). \\n \\nNon-financial firms that, in addition to the production of goods and/or services, trade \\non  own  account  in  financial  instruments  as  part  of  their  business  activities  (e.g. \\nindustrial  companies  for  hedging  purposes)  can  be  considered  firms  professionally \\narranging  or  executing  transactions  in  financial  instruments  under  Article  16(2)  of \\nMAR. The fact that they have staff or a structure dedicated to systematically deal on \\nown account, such as a trading desk, or that they execute their own orders directly on \\na trading venue as defined under MiFID II, are indicators to consider a non-financial \\nfirm as a person professionally arranging or executing transactions. \\n \\nIt is reminded that detecting and reporting suspicious orders and transactions under \\nArticle  16(2)  of  MAR  should  be  applied  by  “persons  professionally  arranging  or \\nexecuting  transactions”  through  the  implementation  of  arrangements,  systems  and \\nprocedures  that  are  appropriate  and  proportionate  to  the  scale,  size  and  nature  of \\ntheir business activity \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\n \\n \\n7.  Questions and Answers on Managers’ transactions \\n \\nExchange rate  \\nUpdated: 26 October 2016 \\n \\n \\nQ7.1 \\nFor transactions carried out under Article 19(1) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 \\nof the European Parliament and of the council (MAR) in a currency which is not \\nEuro (EUR), which exchange rate should be used to determine if the threshold \\nset forth in Article 19(8) MAR of EUR 5 000 has been crossed? \\n \\nA7.1 \\nIf transactions are carried out in a currency which is not the EUR, the exchange rate \\nto  be  used  to  determine  if  the  threshold  is  reached  is  the  official  daily  spot foreign \\nexchange rate which is applicable at the end of the business day when the transaction \\nis  conducted.  Where  available,  the  daily  euro  foreign  exchange  reference  rate \\npublished by the European Central Bank on its website should be used. \\n \\n \\n \\nTiming of the closed period \\nUpdated: 13 July 2016 \\n \\n \\nQ7.2  Does  the  «announcement»  of  the  interim  or  year-end  financial  results \\ndetermines  the  timing  of  the  closed  period  referred  to  in  Article  19(11)  of \\nRegulation (EU) No 596/2014 (MAR)? \\n \\nA7.2 \\n \\nAccording  to  MAR,  there  should  be  only  one  closed  period  relating  to  the \\nannouncement of every interim financial report and another relating to the year-end \\nreport. \\nThe term «announcement» of an interim or a year–end financial report used in Article \\n19(11) of MAR is the public statement whereby the issuer announces the information \\nincluded in an interim or a year-end financial report that the issuer is obliged to make \\npublic  according  to  the  rules  of  the  trading  venue  where  the  issuer’s  shares  are \\nadmitted to trading or national law. The date when the «announcement» is made is \\nthe end date for the thirty-day closed period. \\n \\nWith particular reference to the year-end financial report, the «announcement» is the \\npublic statement whereby the issuer announces, in advance to the publication of the \\nfinal  year-end  report,  the  preliminary  financial  results  agreed  by  the  management \\nbody of the issuer and that will be included in that report. This can apply only if the \\ndisclosed preliminary financial results contain all the key information relating to the \\nfinancial  figures  expected  to  be  included  in  the  year-end  report.  In  the  event  the \\ninformation announced in such way changes after its publication, this will not trigger \\nanother closed period but should be addressed in accordance with Article 17 of MAR.  \\n \\nIn  any  case,  persons  discharging  managerial  responsibilities  remain  subject  at  all \\ntimes to Articles 14 and 15 of MAR prohibiting insider dealing and attempted insider \\n17 \\n \\n \\n \\ndealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, as well as market manipulation and \\nattempted market manipulation.  \\n \\n \\n \\nThreshold calculation \\nUpdated: 20 December 2016 \\n \\n \\nQ7.3  When  calculating  whether  the  threshold  triggering  the  notification  obligation \\nunder  Article 19(1) of MAR is reached (5.000 EUR or 20.000 EUR), should the \\ntransactions  carried  out  by  a  person  discharging  managerial  responsibilities \\n(PDMR) and by closely associated persons to that PDMR be aggregated? \\n \\nA7.3 \\n \\nNo, the transactions carried out by a PDMR and by closely associated persons to that \\nPDMR should not be aggregated.  \\nThis  involves  that  where  the  overall  transactions  singularly  carried  out  by  either  a \\nPDMR or any closely associated person to that PDMR do not reach the threshold, \\nthose  persons  should  not  notify  those  transactions  even  where  the  threshold  is \\nreached aggregating all the transactions carried out by the PDMR and all the closely \\nassociated persons to them.  \\n \\nA  practical  example  is  a  CEO  buying  4.000  EUR  of  equity  and  her  spouse  buying \\nanother  2.000  EUR.  In  such  a  case,  none  of  them  has  reached  the  5.000  EUR \\nthreshold and thus a notification is not required. \\n \\n \\n \\nPrice of gifts, donation and inheritance \\nUpdated: 20 December 2016 \\n \\n \\nQ7.4  Which are the rules to calculate the price of gifts, donations and inheritance for \\nthe purpose of the notifications and disclosure of managers’ transactions under \\nArticle 19 of MAR? \\n \\nA7.4 \\n \\nAccording  to  Article  10(2)(k)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/522, \\ndonations and gifts made or received or inheritance received are transactions to be \\nnotified under Article 19(1) of MAR. \\nThe value of these transactions need to be taken into consideration for the purpose \\nof calculating the cumulated amount of the transactions of a PDMR or a person closely \\nassociated to a PDMR, to assess whether the threshold (EUR 5 000 or EUR 20 000) \\nreferred to  in  Article  19(8)  and (9)  of  MAR  has  been  crossed,  hence  triggering  the \\nduty to notify and disclose all subsequent transactions. \\n \\nThe field 4(c) on “Price(s) and volume(s)” of the template in the annex to Commission \\nImplementing  Regulation  (EU)  2016/523  (Implementing  technical  standards  on  the \\nnotification  and  public  disclosure  of  managers’  transactions)  specifies  the  data \\nstandards  to  be  used  for  expressing  the  price,  depending  on  the  type  of  financial \\ninstruments  concerned.  In  that  respect,  such  template  makes  reference  to  data \\nstandards defined for the purpose of the transaction reporting under Regulation (EU) \\n18 \\n \\n \\n \\n600/2014 (MiFIR) and related technical standards. However, it does not explain the \\nrules about the price to take into account to calculate the value of a donation, a gift or \\ninheritance. \\n \\nFor the purpose of the threshold calculation, the price to consider for donations, gifts \\nand inheritance is the last published price for the financial instrument concerned in \\naccordance with the post trade transparency requirements under MiFIR (Articles 6, \\n10, 20 and 21) on the date of acceptance of the donation, gift or inheritance (i.e. the \\ndate  of  the  transaction),  or  where  such  price  is  not  available  that  day,  the  last \\npublished price. \\n \\nIn the period before MiFIR becomes applicable, the price to use will be:  \\n \\n- \\n \\n- \\nfor shares admitted to trading on regulated markets (RM), the last \\npublished price in accordance with the post trade transparency \\nrequirements under Articles 30 and 45 of Directive 2004/39/EC (MiFID \\nI) on the date of acceptance of the donation, gift or inheritance or where \\nsuch price is not available that day, the last published price;  \\nfor shares admitted to trading or traded on MTFs only, bonds and \\nderivatives or financial instrument linked thereto, the last traded price on \\nthe trading venue where the concerned financial instruments are traded, \\non the date of acceptance of the donation, gift or inheritance, or where \\nsuch price is not available that day, the last traded price before the date \\nof acceptance.  \\n \\nDuring the interim, in the case of shares being traded on several venues (RMs and/or \\nMTFs), then the concept of “most relevant markets in terms of liquidity” under MiFID \\nI and specified in the Commission Regulation (EC) 1287/2006 implementing MiFID I \\nshould be used to determine the trading venue to consider when looking at the last \\ntraded price. For other instruments, the concept of trading venue of first admission \\nshould be used.  \\n \\nFurthermore, where debt instruments admitted to trading or traded on a RM or a MTF \\nare  only  traded  OTC  (i.e.  there  is  no  trading  on  RM  nor  MTF),  then  the  price  to \\nconsider should be the last publicly available price for that debt instrument (whatever \\nis the source).  \\n \\nHowever, when a notification has to be made in accordance with Article 19(1) of MAR \\nand Article 2 of the Implementing technical standards on the notification and public \\ndisclosure of managers’ transactions, the price field for a gift, donation or inheritance \\nis expected to be populated with 0 (zero).  \\n \\n \\n \\nNotification of shares received as part of remuneration package \\nUpdated: 20 December 2016 \\n \\n \\nQ7.5  Do shares received by a PDMR as part of a remuneration package have to be \\nnotified  pursuant  to  Article  19(1)  MAR  and  Article  10(2)(i)  Commission \\nRegulation 2016/522 only upon the occurrence of certain conditions? \\n19 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nA7.5 \\nThe  rationale  of  Article  19(1)  of  MAR  is  mainly  to  prevent  insider  dealing  and  to \\nprovide  investors  with  a  highly  valuable  source  of  information.  A  notification  of \\nentering into a remuneration package contract, according to which a PDMR is entitled \\nto receive shares only upon the occurrence of certain conditions, is not covered by \\nthat  rationale.  Therefore,  pursuant  to  Article  19(1)  of  MAR  and  Article  10(2)(i)  of \\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/522, the PDMR has to notify only upon \\nthe occurrence of the conditions and the actual execution of the transaction. \\n \\n \\n \\nPrice of options granted for free \\nUpdated: 20 January 2017 \\n \\n \\nQ7.6  Which  are  the  rules  to  calculate  the  price  of  options  granted  for  free  to \\nmanagers or employees for the purpose of the notifications and disclosure of \\nmanagers’ transactions under Article 19 of MAR? \\n \\nA7.6 \\nAccording  to  Article  10(2)(b)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/522, \\nsuch transactions have to be notified under Article 19(1) of MAR.  \\n \\nThe value of these transactions needs to be taken into consideration for the purpose \\nof  calculating  the  cumulated  amount  of  the  transactions  of  a  person  discharging \\nmanagerial  responsibility  (PDMR)  or  a  person  closely  associated  to  a  PDMR,  to \\nassess whether the threshold (EUR 5 000 or EUR 20 000) referred to in Article 19(8) \\nand (9) of MAR has been crossed, hence triggering the duty to notify and disclose all \\nsubsequent transactions. \\n \\nThe field  4(c)  on “Price(s)  and  volume(s)”  of  the  template  in  annex  to  Commission \\nImplementing  Regulation  (EU)  2016/523  (Implementing  technical  standards  on  the \\nnotification  and  public  disclosure  of  managers’  transactions)  specifies  the  data \\nstandard  to  be  used  for  expressing  the  price,  depending  on  the  type  of  financial \\ninstruments  concerned.  In  that  respect,  such  template  makes  reference  to  data \\nstandards defined for the purpose of the transaction reporting under Regulation (EU) \\n600/2014 (MiFIR) and related technical standards. However, it does not explain the \\nrules about the price to take into account to calculate the value of the received options.  \\n \\nFor  the  purpose  of  the  threshold  calculation,  the  price  to  consider  for  the  received \\noptions should be based on the economic value assigned to the options by the issuer \\nwhen granting them. If such an economic value is not known, the price to consider \\nshould  be  based  on  an  option  pricing  model  that  is  generally  accepted  in  the \\nreasonable  opinion  of  the  PDMR.  This  model  determines  the  price  of  the  granted \\noption based on variables such as the current share price of the issuer, exercise price \\nof the option and time until expiry of the option. Other variables that can be used in \\nthe  option  pricing  model  are  (risk  free)  interest  rates,  future  dividends  and  implied \\nvolatility. The variables used for the price determination of the granted option depends \\non which general accepted option pricing model is used.  \\n \\nHowever, when a notification has to be made in accordance with Article 19(1) of MAR \\nand Article 2 of the Implementing technical standards on the notification and public \\n20 \\n \\n \\n \\ndisclosure  of  managers’  transactions,  the  price  field  for  options  granted  for  free  to \\nmanagers or employees is expected to be populated with 0 (zero). \\n  \\n \\nClosely associated persons under Article 3(1)(26)(d) of MAR   \\nUpdated: 6 July 2017 \\n \\n \\nQ7.7  According to Article 3(1)(26)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European \\nParliament and of the council (MAR) a closely associated person is, inter alia, \\n«a legal person, trust or partnership, the managerial responsibilities of which \\nare  discharged»  by  a  person  discharging managerial  responsibilities  (PDMR) \\nor by a closely associated natural person. Is the reference to «the managerial \\nresponsibilities of which are discharged» contained in Article 3(1)(26)(d) of MAR \\nto be read in the same way as the definition of PDMR within an issuer contained \\nin Article 3(1)(25) of MAR?  \\n \\nA7.7 \\n \\nNo,  the  reference  to  «the  managerial  responsibilities  of  which  are  discharged»  in \\nArticle 3(1)(26)(d) of MAR should be read to cover those cases where a PDMR within \\nan  issuer  (or  a  closely  associated  natural  person)  takes  part  in  or  influences  the \\ndecisions  of  another  legal  person,  trust  or  partnership  (hereinafter  “legal  entity”)  to \\ncarry out transactions in financial instruments of the issuer. \\nFor example, in the case of mere cross board membership, where a person sits in the \\nadministrative, management or supervisory body of an issuer and also in the board of \\nanother legal entity where they exercise executive or non-executive functions, without \\nhowever  taking  part  nor  influencing  the  decisions  of  that  legal  entity  to  carry  out \\ntransactions  in  financial  instruments  of  the  issuer,  then  that  person  should  not  be \\nconsidered  discharging  managerial  responsibilities  within  that  legal  entity  for  the \\npurposes  of  Article  3(1)(26)(d)  of  MAR.  Therefore,  that  legal  entity  should  not  be \\nsubject to the notification obligations under Article 19(1) of MAR, unless it is directly \\nor  indirectly  controlled  by,  is  set  up for the  benefit  of,  or  its  economic  interests  are \\nsubstantially equivalent to those of that person.  \\n \\n \\nTrading during closed periods and prohibition of insider dealing   \\nUpdated: 21 November 2017  \\n \\n \\nQ7.8  How should permission to trade in a closed period, which may be granted in \\ncertain circumstances to PDRMs in accordance with Article 19(12) of MAR, be \\nconsidered in the context of Article 14 of MAR? \\n \\nA7.8 \\n \\n \\nThe insider dealing prohibition contained in Article 14 of MAR applies during closed \\nperiods referred to in Article 19(11) of MAR in the same way as it does at any other \\ntime, and must therefore be complied with by PDMRs. This means that when an issuer \\nallows  a  PDMR  to  trade  under  Article  19(12)  of  MAR,  the  general  insider  dealing \\nprovisions still apply and the PDMR must always give consideration as to whether or \\nnot the relevant transaction would constitute insider dealing. \\n21 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTypes of transactions by PDMRs prohibited during closed periods  \\nUpdated: 21 November 2017 \\n \\n \\nQ7.9  Are  the  types  of  \"transaction\"  by  a  PDMR  prohibited  during  a  closed  period \\nunder Article 19(11) of MAR the same as those types of transaction subject to \\nthe notification requirements set out under Article 19(1) of MAR? \\n \\nA7.9 \\nYes.  \\n \\nIt is pointed out that Article 19(11) of MAR only applies to a PDMR when conducting \\ntransactions  on  its  own  account  or  for  the  account  of  a  third  party  whereas  the \\nnotification of transactions required under Article 19(1) of MAR also applies to persons \\nclosely associated to a PDMR. \\n \\n8.

When  determining  whether  a  communication  is  an \\n\"investment  recommendation\",  an  assessment  should  be  made  based  on  the \\nsubstance  of  the  communication,  irrespective  of  its  name  or  label  and  the  format, \\nform,  or  the  medium  through  which  it  is  delivered  (whether  electronically,  orally  or \\notherwise).  As  such,  whether  a  specific  oral  or  electronic  communication,  or  a \\ncommunication labelled as “morning notes” or “sales notes”, may be considered an \\ninvestment recommendation within the meaning of MAR, it should be established on \\na case-by-case basis.  \\n \\nWhere a standardised communication, including oral or electronic communication, is \\nstructured  and  pre-planned  for  distribution  channels  and  it  implicitly  or  explicitly \\nsuggests an investment strategy in relation to a financial instrument or issuer, it should \\nbe regarded as \"investment recommendation\".  \\n \\n \\n \\nCommunications not referring to one or several issuers \\nUpdated: 26 October 2016 \\n \\n \\nQ8.2  Can  communications  that  do  not  refer  to  either  one  or  several  financial \\ninstruments  or  issuers  be  considered  investment  recommendations  under \\nMAR? \\n \\nA8.2 \\nthat  meet \\nthe  criteria  of \\nthe  definition  of \\nCommunications \\n“investment \\nrecommendation” within the meaning of Article 3(1)(35) of MAR in conjunction with \\nArticle  3(1)(34)  of  MAR  will  be  deemed  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  investment \\nrecommendation regime.  \\n \\nIn  particular,  Article  3(1)(35)  of  MAR  sets  out  that  “investment  recommendation” \\nmeans \"information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy, explicitly or \\nimplicitly,  concerning  one  or  several  financial  instruments  or  the  issuers \\n[emphasis added], including any opinion as to the present or future value or price of \\nsuch instruments, intended for distribution channels or for the public\". \\n \\nTherefore, a communication that does not refer to either a financial instrument or an \\nissuer, should generally not be considered an investment recommendation. However, \\nthe  producer’s  assessment  as  to  whether  the  above  communication  may  be \\ninvestment recommendation should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. \\n \\nCommunication relating solely to spot currency rates, sectors, interest rates, loans, \\ncommodities,  macroeconomic  variables  or  industry  sectors  and  not  referring  to  a \\nfinancial instrument or an issuer would be considered as investment recommendation \\nwhere it contains information assessed as allowing a reasonable investor to deduce \\nthat the  communication  is  implicitly  recommending  specific financial  instruments  or \\n23 \\n \\n \\n \\nissuers  and  provided  that  the  other  criteria  of  the  definition  of  “investment \\nrecommendation” within the meaning of Article 3(1)(35) of MAR in conjunction with \\nArticle 3(1)(34) of MAR are met. For example, an opinion on a specific sector that is \\ncomposed  of  a  very  limited  number  of  issuers  may  be  considered  an  investment \\nrecommendation regarding those issuers. \\n \\n \\n \\nMain businesss is not to produce investment recommendations \\nUpdated: 26 Octobre 2016 \\n \\n \\nQ8.3  Would an investment firm which produces an investment recommendation be \\nconsidered to fall within the scope of Article 3(1)(34)(i) of MAR, even though the \\nproduction of such recommendation is not its main business?  \\n \\nA8.3  With regard to an investment firm, any information that comprises direct or indirect \\ninvestment  proposals  in  respect  of  a  financial  instrument  or  an  issuer  will  be \\nconsidered  as  information  recommending  or  suggesting  an  investment  strategy  as \\ndefined under point (i) of Article 3(1)(34) of MAR.

Those  financial  instruments  have  to  be \\nfinancial instruments covered by the MAR scope as specified in Article 2(1) of MAR: \\n \\na)  financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market or for which a \\nrequest for admission to trading on a regulated market has been made;  \\n \\nb)  financial instruments traded on an MTF, admitted to trading on an MTF or for \\nwhich a request for admission to trading on an MTF has been made;  \\nc)  financial instruments traded on an OTF;  \\nd)  financial instruments not covered by point (a), (b) or (c), the price or value of \\nwhich depends on or has an effect on the price or value of a financial \\ninstrument referred to in those points, including, but not limited to, credit \\ndefault swaps and contracts for difference.  \\n \\nWhere the financial instrument subject to the possible transaction is already admitted \\nto trading (or  a request for  admission  to  trading has  been made)  or  is traded  on  a \\ntrading venue, as for example when the new transaction relates to an increase of an \\nexisting issuance, then that transaction will fall within scope of Article 11.  \\n \\nWhere the financial instrument subject to the possible transaction is not admitted to \\ntrading (nor a request for admission to trading has been made) nor traded on a trading \\nvenue, that financial instrument would not fall under Article 2(1)(a)-(c) of MAR. That \\nfinancial instrument would fall under Article 2(1)(d) of MAR if its price or value depends \\non or has an effect on the price or value of  another existing financial instrument in \\nscope of MAR.  \\n \\nIn such a case, to determine if Article 2(1)(d) applies, the DMP must assess on a case \\nby  case  basis  whether  there  is  any  relationship  between  the  price  or  value  of  the \\nfinancial instrument that is the subject of the sounding and any other existing financial \\ninstrument falling under Article 2(1)(a)-(c) of MAR such as, for instance, other financial \\ninstruments of the issuer in question or of a parent company. DMPs are expected to \\nbe able to document their assessment. \\n \\n28 \\n \\n \\n \\nWhere the DMP assessed that such relationship exists, then the financial instrument \\nwill be in scope of MAR and the related possible transaction will be in scope of the \\nMAR market sounding regime.  \\n \\nIf  there  is  uncertainty  as  to  whether  there  is  a  price  or  value  relationship,  such  as \\nwhere there are no data available regarding a new financial instrument, in order to \\nreceive the protection under Article 11, should it be subsequently shown that there \\nwas  a  relationship,  an  appropriate  approach  would  be  for  the  DMP  to  apply  the \\nprovisions  of  Article  11  of  MAR  and  the  relevant  delegated  and  implementing \\nregulations. \\n \\n10.

The  issuer  will  remain \\nresponsible for complying with the insider list requirements in relation to its own insider \\nlist, the drawing up and updating of which has been delegated to the same person as \\npart of a separate agreement. \\n \\n11.  Questions  and  Answers  on  emission  allowances  and \\nemission allowances market participants (EAMPs) \\n \\nTime span for the calculation of the CO2 equivalent emissions and the rated thermal \\ninput  \\n  \\nUpdated: 14 December 2017  \\n \\n \\nQ11.1  What period should be used to calculate whether one of the thresholds set out \\nin  Article  17(2)  of  MAR  has  been  exceeded?  As  of  when  is  this  threshold \\ndeemed to be crossed? \\n \\nA11.1  A  participant  in  the  emission  allowance  market  should  use  a  calendar  year  period \\n(one-year period that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31) for the annual \\ncalculation  of  the  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  emissions  and  the  rated  thermal  input \\n(RTI) of 31 December of the same year.  \\n \\nThe calculated emissions over a given year (Y) or the RTI as of 31 December of a \\ngiven year (Y) should be assessed against the minimum thresholds of 6 million tonnes \\na  year  of  equivalent  carbon  dioxide  or  the  minimum  RTI  threshold  of  2  430  MW \\nspecified  in  Article  5(1)(a)  and  (b)  of  the  Commission  Delegated  regulation  (EU) \\n2016/522. Where either of these thresholds is exceeded, the market participant will \\nbe  deemed  to  be  an  emission  allowance  market  participant  (EAMP)  as  defined  in \\nArticle 3(20) of MAR as of 1 May of the following year (Y+1) and thus subject to the \\nobligations  applicable to  EAMPs  under  MAR,  including the  requirement to  disclose \\ninside  information  concerning  emission  allowances  it,  or  its  parent  undertaking  or \\nrelated undertakings, may hold. This approach for MAR purpose will be aligned with \\nthe compliance cycle of the EU Emissions Trading System stemming from Directive \\n2003/87/EC. \\n \\nIn practice, this means that the year of reference for the calculations should be 2016 \\nto determine whether a participant is an EAMP between 3 January and 30 April 2018, \\nand 2017 to determine whether a participant is an EAMP from 1 May 2018 onwards, \\nuntil the next calculations become applicable on 1 May 2019.  \\n \\n30 \\n \\n \\n \\nIt  is  reminded that  the  calculations  should  take  into  account  all  business,  including \\naviation  activities  or  installations,  which  a  participant  in  the  emission  allowance \\nmarket, or its parent undertaking or related undertaking owns or controls or for the \\noperational  matters  of  which  that  participant,  or  its  parent  undertaking  or  related \\nundertaking is responsible, in whole or in part. \\n31 \\n'"
