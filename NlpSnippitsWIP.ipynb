Background \\n1.  The  Alternative  Investment  Fund  Managers  Directive  (AIFMD)  puts  in  place  a \\ncomprehensive framework for the regulation of alternative investment fund managers \\nwithin  Europe.  The  extensive  requirements  with  which  AIFMs  must  comply  are \\ndesigned to  ensure  that these managers can manage  AIFs  on  a cross-border  basis \\nand the AIFs that they manage can be sold on a cross-border basis.  \\n2.  The AIFMD framework is made up of the following EU legislation:  \\n\\uf0b7  Directive 2011/61/EU1, which was adopted in 2011. It is a ‘framework’ Level 1 \\ntechnical  delegated  and \\nDirective  which  has  been  supplemented  by \\nimplementing measures.  \\n\\uf0b7  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  No  231/2013 2 ,  Commission  Regulation  (EU) \\nNo 447/20133,  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  No  448/20134,  and  Commission \\nRegulation (EU) No 694/20145. \\n3.  ESMA is required to play an active role in building a common supervisory culture by \\npromoting common supervisory approaches and practices. In this regard, the Authority \\ndevelops Q&As as and when appropriate to elaborate on the provisions of certain EU \\nlegislation or ESMA guidelines.  \\n4.  The European Commission has already published its own Q&A on AIFMD6.  \\nII. Purpose \\n5.  The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  promote  common  supervisory  approaches  and \\npractices in the application of the AIFMD and its implementing measures. It does this \\nby  providing  responses  to  questions  posed  by  the  general  public  and  competent \\nauthorities in relation to the practical application of the AIFMD.  \\n6.  The content of this document is aimed at competent authorities under AIFMD to ensure \\nthat  in  their  supervisory  activities  their  actions  are  converging  along  the  lines  of  the \\nresponses adopted by ESMA. However, the answers are also intended to help AIFMs \\n                                                \\n1 DIRECTIVE  2011/61/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  8  June  2011  on  Alternative  Investment  Fund \\nManagers and amending Directives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 1095/2010 \\n2 COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 231/2013 of 19 December 2012 supplementing Directive 2011/61/EU of \\nthe  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  exemptions,  general  operating  conditions,  depositaries,  leverage, \\ntransparency and supervision \\n3 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 447/2013 of 15 May 2013 establishing the procedure for AIFMs which \\nchoose to opt in under Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council \\n4 COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 448/2013 of 15 May 2013 establishing a procedure for determining the \\nMember State of reference of a non-EU AIFM pursuant to Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council \\n5 COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 694/2014 of 17 December 2013 supplementing Directive 2011/61/EU of \\nthe  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  regulatory  technical  standards  determining  types  of  alternative \\ninvestment fund managers \\n6 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/aifmd-commission-questions-answers_en.pdf  \\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\nby providing clarity as to the content of the AIFMD rules, rather than creating an extra \\nlayer of requirements. \\nIII. Status  \\n7.  The  Q&A  mechanism  is  a  practical  convergence  tool  used  to  promote  common \\nsupervisory approaches and practices under Article 29(2) of the ESMA Regulation.7  \\n8.  Therefore,  due  to  the  nature  of  Q&As,  formal  consultation  on  the  draft  answers  is \\nconsidered unnecessary. However, even if they are not formally consulted on, ESMA \\nmay check them with representatives of ESMA’s Securities and Markets Stakeholder \\nGroup,  the  relevant  Standing  Committees’  Consultative  Working  Group  or,  where \\nspecific expertise is needed, with other external parties. \\n9.  ESMA  will review these questions and answers on a regular basis to identify if, in a \\ncertain area, there is a need to convert some of the material into ESMA guidelines. In \\nsuch cases, the procedures foreseen under Article 16 of the ESMA Regulation will be \\nfollowed.  \\nIV. Questions and answers  \\n10. This  document  is  intended  to  be  continually  edited  and  updated  as  and  when  new \\nquestions  are  received.  The  date  each  question  was  last  amended  is  included  after \\neach question for ease of reference.  \\n \\n \\n                                                \\n7 Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a  European \\nSupervisory  Authority  (European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority),  amending  Decision  No  716/2009/EC  and  repealing \\nCommission Decision 2009/77/EC Regulation, 15.12.2010, L331/84.  \\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection I: Remuneration \\nDate last updated: 27 June 2014 \\nQuestion  1  [last  update  17  February  2014]:  To  which  accounting  period  should  AIFMs \\nperforming activities under the AIFMD before 22 July 2013 and submitting an application for \\nauthorisation  under  the  AIFMD  between  22  July  2013  and  22  July  2014  apply  the  AIFMD \\nremuneration rules for the first time?  \\nAnswer 1: Paragraph 4 of the Guidelines on sound remuneration policies under the AIFMD \\n(ESMA/2013/232) (the Remuneration Guidelines) states that “These Guidelines apply from 22 \\nJuly 2013, subject to the transitional provisions of the AIFMD”. The Commission Q&A on the \\nAIFMD  provided  specific  guidance  on  the  interpretation  of  the  transitional  provisions  under \\nArticle 61(1) of the AIFMD.8  \\nAccording to Article 61(1) of the AIFMD, AIFMs performing activities under the AIFMD before \\n22 July 2013 have one year from that date to submit an application for authorisation. Once a \\nfirm becomes  authorised  under  the  AIFMD,  it  becomes  subject  to  the  AIFMD  remuneration \\nrules and the Remuneration Guidelines. Therefore, the relevant rules should start applying as \\nof the date of authorisation. \\nHowever, as for the rules on variable remuneration (i.e. the ones for which guidance is provided \\nunder  Sections  XI.  (Guidelines  on  the  general  requirements  on  risk  alignment)  and  XII. \\n(Guidelines on the specific requirements on risk alignment) of the Remuneration Guidelines), \\nAIFMs should apply them for the calculation of payments relating to new awards of variable \\nremuneration  to  their  identified  staff  (as  defined  in  the  Remuneration  Guidelines)  for \\nperformance periods following that in which they become authorised. So the AIFMD regime on \\nvariable remuneration should apply only to full performance periods and should first apply to \\nthe first full performance period after the AIFM becomes authorised. For example: \\n1.  An existing AIFM whose accounting period ends on 31 December and which obtained \\nan authorisation between 22 July 2013 and 31 December  2013: the AIFMD rules on \\nvariable remuneration should apply to the calculation of payments relating to the 2014 \\naccounting period. \\n2.  An  existing  AIFM  whose  accounting  period  ends  on  31  December  obtains  an \\nauthorisation between 1 January 2014 and 22 July 2014: the AIFMD rules on variable \\nremuneration  should  apply  to  the  calculation  of  payments  relating  to  the  2015 \\naccounting period.  \\nHowever, for an existing AIFM whose accounting period ends on 31 December which submits \\nan application for authorisation by 22 July 2014 and obtains an authorisation after that date \\n(including when the authorisation is obtained after 31 December 2014), the AIFMD rules on \\n                                                \\n8 ID 1180. Transitional provisions, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/yqol/index.cfm?fuseaction=question.show&questionId=1180.  \\n5 \\n \\n \\n \\nvariable  remuneration  should  apply  to  the  calculation  of  payments  relating  to  the  2015 \\naccounting period. \\nQuestion 2 [last update 17 February 2014]: To which accounting period should AIFMs not \\nperforming  activities  under  the  AIFMD  before  22  July  2013  and  obtaining  an  authorisation \\nunder the AIFMD after 22 July 2013 apply the remuneration rules for the first time? \\nAnswer  2:  Once  a  firm  becomes  authorised  under  the  AIFMD,  it  becomes  subject  to  the \\nAIFMD  remuneration  rules  and  the  Remuneration  Guidelines  and  the  relevant  rules  should \\nstart to apply as of the date of authorisation. \\nHowever, as for the rules on variable remuneration (i.e. the ones for which guidance is provided \\nunder  Sections  XI.  (Guidelines  on  the  general  requirements  on  risk  alignment)  and  XII. \\n(Guidelines on the specific requirements on risk alignment) of the Remuneration Guidelines), \\nAIFMs should apply them for the calculation of payments relating to new awards of variable \\nremuneration  to  their  identified  staff  (as  defined  in  the  Remuneration  Guidelines)  for \\nperformance periods following that in which they submit an application for authorisation. An \\nAIFM submitting an application for authorisation in the year N (after 22 July 2013), should apply \\nthe AIFMD remuneration regime on variable remuneration only to the calculation of payments \\nrelating to the accounting period for year N+1. \\nQuestion 3 [last update 17 February 2014]: Which staff of the delegate should be covered \\nby  the  “appropriate  contractual  arrangements”  that  ensure  there  is  no  circumvention  of  the \\nremuneration rules as set out in paragraph 18(b) of the Remuneration Guidelines?  \\nAnswer 3: Such contractual arrangements must only be in place in respect of the delegate’s \\nidentified  staff  who  have  a  material  impact  on  the  risk  profiles  of  the  AIFs  it  manages  as  a \\nresult of the delegation, and only in respect of the remuneration for such delegated activities. \\nQuestion 4 [last update 17 February 2014]: In a delegation arrangement where the delegate \\nis  subject  to  the  CRD  rules,  can  the  delegate  be  considered  to  be  subject  to  regulatory \\nrequirements  on  remuneration  that  are  equally  as  effective  as  those  applicable  under  the \\nRemuneration Guidelines? \\nAnswer 4: Provided that the staff of these entities who are identified staff for the purpose of \\nthe  Remuneration  Guidelines  are  subject  to  the  CRD  rules,  these  entities  are  subject  to \\nregulatory  requirements  on  remuneration  that  are  equally  as  effective  as  those  applicable \\nunder the Guidelines. \\nQuestion 5 [last update 27 June 2014]: Can AIFMs choose to exclude portfolio managers \\nfrom  the  scope  of  identified  staff  for  the  purpose  of  the  Remuneration  Guidelines  purely \\nbecause they are bound by investment limits set out by law and/or internal risk limits set out in \\nthe investment restrictions of the AIF? \\nAnswer 5: No. Paragraph 20 of the Remuneration Guidelines provides for a presumption that \\ncertain  categories  of  staff  should  be  included  as  the  identified  staff.  ‘Other  risk  takers’  are \\nmentioned  among  these  categories  of  staff.  This  category  includes  ‘staff  members,  whose \\n6 \\n \\n \\n \\nprofessional activities – either individually or collectively, as members of a group (e.g. a unit or \\npart of a department) – can exert material influence on the AIFM’s risk profile or on an AIF it \\nmanages’.  When  assessing  whether  a  portfolio  manager  can  exert  material  influence,  a \\nnumber of questions are relevant: \\n1)  is the percentage size of the AIF portfolio being managed small?  \\n2)  is the portfolio manager required to meet (and outperform) a performance benchmark?  \\n3)  is the percentage deviation from that benchmark which is tolerated by the AIFM small?  \\n4)  does the AIFM monitor the performance of the portfolio manager daily?  \\nWhere  the  answer  to  any  of the  above questions  is  ‘no’,  a  portfolio manager  is  likely  to fall \\nwithin the scope of identified staff. Where the answer to all of the questions above it ‘yes’, a \\nportfolio manager is more likely to fall outside the scope of identified staff. Given that the criteria \\nare qualitative, it may still be the case that for some combinations of 1) and 3) above, a portfolio \\nmanager may still exert material influence on an AIFM’s risk profile or on an AIF it manages, \\nin which case the Remuneration Guidelines should apply. \\nQuestion  6  [last  update  5  October  2017]:  Do  the  remuneration-related  disclosure \\nrequirements under Article 22(2)(e) of the AIFMD also apply to the staff of the delegate of an \\nAIFM to whom portfolio management or risk management activities have been delegated? \\nAnswer  6:  Yes.  In  line  with  the  approach  followed  under  the  AIFMD  Remuneration \\nGuidelines9, AIFMs can ensure compliance in one of the following two ways: \\ni) \\nii) \\nwhere  the  delegate  is  subject  to  regulatory  requirements  on  remuneration \\ndisclosure for its staff to whom portfolio management or risk management activities \\nhave been delegated that are equally as effective as those under Article 22(2)(e) of \\nthe AIFMD, the AIFM should use the information disclosed by the delegate for the \\npurposes of fulfilling its obligations under Article 22(e) of the AIFMD and Article 107 \\nof the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation; or  \\nin other cases, appropriate contractual arrangements should be put in place with \\nthe delegate allowing the AIFM to receive (and disclose in the annual report for the \\nrelevant  AIF(s)  that  it  manages)  at  least  information  on  the  total  amount  of \\nremuneration for the financial year, split into fixed and variable remuneration, paid \\nby the AIF and/or the AIFM to the identified staff of the delegate – and number of \\nbeneficiaries, and, where relevant, carried interest – which is linked to the delegated \\nportfolio. This means that the disclosure should be done on a prorated basis for the \\npart  of  the  AIF’s  assets  which  are  managed  by  the  identified  staff  within  the \\ndelegate.  \\n                                                \\n9 See paragraph 18 of the AIFMD Remuneration Guidelines. \\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\nIn both situations set out above, the disclosure may be provided on an aggregate basis i.e. by \\nmeans of a total amount for all the delegates of the AIFM in relation to the relevant AIF.  \\nQuestion  7  [last  update  5  October  2017]:  Can  the  information  mentioned  under  Article \\n22(2)(e)  and  (f)  of  the  AIFMD  be  disclosed  in  the  annual  report  by  the  way  of  a  link  to  a \\ndocument where the relevant information is available? \\nAnswer 7: No. The information prescribed by Article 22(2)(e) and (f) of the AIFMD should be \\nincluded in the annual report. This is without  prejudice to references in the annual report to \\nother documents where additional information may be found. \\n \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection II: Notifications of AIFs \\nDate last updated: 7 April 2017 \\nQuestion 1 [last update 17 February 2014]: What additional information should be provided \\nunder letter (f) of Annex IV of the AIFMD? \\nAnswer  1:  Letter  (f)  of  Annex  IV  of  the  AIFMD  should  be  understood  as  requesting  all \\ninformation set out in Article 23(1) of the AIFMD that is not already contained in Annex IV of \\nthe AIFMD. \\nQuestion  2  [last  update  17  February  2014]:  Should  AIFMs  that  wish  to  market  new \\ninvestment  compartments  of  AIFs  in  a  Member  State  where  these  AIFs have  been  already \\nnotified undertake a new notification procedure via their competent authority? \\nAnswer 2: Yes. \\nQuestion 3 [last update 1 April 2016]: If an EU AIF decides to offer additional fund units to \\ninvestors, and the offer is limited to the investors already invested in the AIF, does the AIFM \\nhave to submit a new notification to the national competent authority in accordance with Article \\n31(2) of AIFMD? \\nAnswer 3: No. \\nQuestion 4 [last update 3 June 2016]: For the purposes of Article 31 of AIFMD (marketing \\nof units or shares of EU AIFs in the home Member State of the AIFM), does it make a difference \\nwhether the EU AIF to be marketed is domiciled in the home Member State of the EU AIFM or \\nin another Member State? \\nAnswer 4: No. Article 31 does not differentiate between the marketing of EU AIFs domiciled \\nin the home Member State of the AIFM and EU AIFs domiciled in another Member State. \\nQuestion  5 [last  update  3  June  2016]:  Can  an  authorised  EU  AIFM,  in  its  home  Member \\nState, market an EU feeder AIF with a non-EU master AIF pursuant to Article 31 of AIFMD? \\nAnswer 5: No. Article 31(1), second subparagraph, allows an EU AIFM to market an EU feeder \\nAIF  in  the  home  Member  State  of  the  AIFM  as  long  as  it  has  an  EU  master  AIF  which  is \\nmanaged by an authorised EU AIFM. Marketing of an EU feeder AIF with a non-EU master \\nAIF is subject to Article 36(1) of AIFMD. \\nQuestion 6 [last update 16 November 2016]: An AIF is marketed in a host Member State by \\nway of the AIFMD marketing passport (Article 32 of AIFMD). A new share class of the AIF is \\nset up, which will be marketed in the host Member State. Should this be regarded as a material \\nchange, which would require a new notification pursuant to Article 32? \\nAnswer 6: No. The creation of a share class, which is to be marketed cross-border within an \\nalready notified (sub-)fund, does not constitute a material change of the notification. \\n9 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 7 [last update 16 November 2016]: An AIFM wishes to notify a material change to \\na notification made to the competent authorities in its home Member State to manage or market \\nan  AIF  on  a  cross-border  basis  (Articles  32(7)  or  33(6)  of  AIFMD).  Does  the  AIFM  have  to \\ninclude the full set of documentation required by Articles 32 or 33 in the notification letter? \\nAnswer 7: Yes. Material changes to existing notifications require the AIFM to hand in a full set \\nof  documentation  with  the  revised  notification  letter.  AIFMs  are  asked  to  highlight  any \\namendment to the original notification letter and accompanying documentation. \\nQuestion 8 [last update: 6 April 2017]: In addition to the AIFMD categories of “professional \\ninvestor” and “retail investor”, a number of Member States have introduced further categories \\nfor  retail  investors  (such  as  “qualifying  investor”,  “informed  investor”,  or  “semi-professional \\ninvestor”),  which,  by  their  definition,  share  some,  but  not  all  elements  of  the  definition  of \\n“professional investor” pursuant to Article 4(1)(ag) of AIFMD. Does the AIF marketing passport \\n(Article 32 of AIFMD) extend to those investors? \\nAnswer:  No.  The  AIF  marketing  passport  may  only  be  used  for  marketing  to  professional \\ninvestors as defined in Article 4(1)(ag) of AIFMD. Any other cross-border marketing activity to \\nnon-professional  investors  as  defined  in  Member  States  has  to  be  notified  and  carried  out \\naccording to national legislation in the host Member State of the AIF and cannot be carried out \\nby way of the AIF marketing passport. \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection III: Reporting to national competent authorities under Articles 3, 24 and 42 \\nDate last updated: 24 May 2017 \\nQuestion 1 [last update 16 December 2016]: When a non-EU AIFM reports information to \\nthe national competent authorities of a Member State under Article 42 of the AIFMD, which \\nAIFs have to be included in the reports? \\nAnswer 1: When a non-EU AIFM reports information to the national competent authorities of \\na  Member  State  under Article  42,  only  the  AIFs marketed  in that  Member  State  have  to  be \\ntaken  into  account  for  the  purpose  of  the  reporting.  When  Member  States  apply  ESMA’s \\nopinion on collection of additional information under Article 24(5) of the AIFMD, AIFMs should \\nalso report information on non-EU master AIFs not marketed in the EU that have either EU \\nfeeder AIFs or non-EU feeder AIFs marketed in the Union under Article 42.  Non-EU AIFMs \\nshould apply the same principle if the master AIF is established in the Union and not marketed \\nin  the  Union  (i.e.  they  should  report  information  on  the  EU  master  AIF  not  marketed  in  the \\nUnion). \\nQuestion 2 [last update 25 March 2014]: Should repurchase transactions (at the level of the \\nportfolio of the AIF) by or on behalf of a reporting AIF be considered as financing operations \\nfor the  purpose  of the  AIFMD  reporting  obligations  (questions  54  –  56  and  210-  217  of  the \\nconsolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer  2:  Yes.  Therefore,  AIFMs  should  take  into  account  the  counterparties  of  those \\ntransactions when reporting the information related to funding sources in questions 54  – 56 \\nand take into account the aggregate amount of these transactions in questions 210-217. \\nQuestion 3 [last update 25 March 2014]: Which period should AIFMs use when reporting \\ninformation  on  ‘Instruments  traded  and  individual  exposures’  (questions  121  to  124  of  the \\nconsolidated  reporting  template):  the  residual  maturity  of  the  instrument  or  the  maturity  at \\nissuance? \\nAnswer 3: AIFMs should use the residual maturity as of the reporting date. \\nQuestion  4  [last  update  25  March  2014]: What  should  be  the  basis  of  the  numerator  for \\ncalculating the geographical exposure as a percentage of the NAV of the AIF (question 78 to \\n85 of the consolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 4: The numerator used for calculating the geographical exposure as a percentage of \\nthe  net  asset  value  of  the  AIF  should  be  the  NAV  of  the  AIF  for  each  geographical  area. \\nTherefore,  this  may  result  in  negative  values  for  certain  regions  but  the  total  should  equal \\n100%. \\n11 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 5 [last update 25 March 2014]: What should be the basis of the numerator and the \\ndenominator  for  calculating  the  geographical  exposure  as  a  percentage  of  the  aggregated \\nvalue of the AIF (questions 86 to 93 of the consolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 5: The numerator used for calculating the geographical exposure as a percentage of \\nthe aggregated value of the AIF should be the total value of assets under management of the \\nAIF for each geographical area. The basis for the denominator should the total value of assets \\nunder management of the AIF. The total should equal 100%. \\nQuestion  6  [last  update  25  March  2014]: What  should  be  the  basis  of  the  numerator  for \\ncalculating  the  breakdown  of  investment  strategies  as  a  percentage  of  the  NAV  of  the  AIF \\n(question 60 of the consolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 6: The numerator used for calculating the breakdown of investment strategies as a \\npercentage of the NAV of the AIF should be the net asset value of the AIF for each investment \\nstrategy. Therefore, this may result in negative values for certain investment strategies but the \\ntotal should equal 100%.  \\nQuestion 7 [last update 25 March 2014]: ESMA’s guidelines recommend that AIFMs submit \\nthe last report of the AIF immediately after it has been liquidated or put into liquidation. When \\nshould AIFMs submit this last report? \\nAnswer 7: AIFMs should submit the last AIF report not later than one month after the end of \\nthe quarter in which the AIF has been liquidated or put into liquidation. \\nQuestion  8  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  percentage  of \\nmarket value for securities traded on regulated markets and OTC markets (questions 148 and \\n149 of the consolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 8: AIFMs should aggregate the market value of all securities traded and report the \\npercentage  of  the  market  value  of  securities  traded  on  a  regulated  exchange  and  OTC. \\nRegulated exchanges include regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities and organised \\ntrading  facilities.  For  the  European  Union,  regulated  markets 10  and  multilateral  trading \\nfacilities 11 are  published  on  ESMA’s  website.  Securities  that  are  not  traded  on  regulated \\nexchanges should be considered as traded OTC. This means that the total should equal 100%. \\nQuestion  9  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  percentage  of \\ntrade volumes for derivatives traded on regulated markets and OTC markets (questions 150 \\nand 151 of the consolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer  9:  AIFMs  should  take  into  account  the  total  number  of  trades  and  report  the \\npercentage  of  number  of  trades  on  a  regulated  exchange  and  OTC.  Regulated  exchanges \\n                                                \\n10 \\nhttp://mifiddatabase.esma.europa.eu/Index.aspx?sectionlinks_id=23&language=0&pageName=REGULATED_MARKETS_Displ\\nay  \\n11 http://mifiddatabase.esma.europa.eu/Index.aspx?sectionlinks_id=22&language=0&pageName=MTF_Display \\n12 \\n \\n \\n \\ninclude regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities. For the \\nEuropean  Union,  regulated  markets 12  and  multilateral  trading  facilities 13  are  published  on \\nESMA’s website. Securities that are not traded on regulated exchanges should be considered \\nas traded OTC. This means that the total should equal 100%. \\nQuestion 10 [last update 25 March 2014]: How should AIFMs report the information on the \\nliquidity portfolio when the AIF is invested in assets with no current liquidity for which it is not \\npossible  to  determine  the  future  liquidity  (questions  178  -184  of  the  consolidated  reporting \\ntemplate)?  \\nAnswer  10:  In  that  case,  AIFMs  should  adopt  a  conservative  approach  and  assign  the \\ninstrument to the longest period bucket. \\nQuestion  11  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  the  information  on \\ninvestor liquidity? \\nAnswer 11: AIFMs should divide the AIF’s NAV among the period buckets depending on the \\nshortest  period  within  which  investors  are  entitled,  under  the  fund  documents,  to  withdraw \\ninvested funds or receive redemption payments, as applicable. \\nFor  example,  an  AIF  has  a  NAV  of  €  1,000,000  with  two  investors.  According  to  the  fund \\ndocuments, investor A whose share of the NAV is €600,000 is entitled to withdraw 50% of its \\ninvestment  on  a  daily  basis  and  50%  of  its  investments  between  2  and 7  days.  Investor  B, \\nwhose share of the NAV is €400,000, is entitled to withdraw 60% of its investments between \\n31 and 90 days and 40% of its investment within 91 and 180 days. The investor profile of the \\nAIF will be the following: \\n1  day  or \\nless \\n30% \\n2-7 days \\n8-30 days \\n31-90 days  91-180 \\n30% \\n0 \\n24% \\ndays \\n16% \\n181-365 \\ndays \\n0 \\nMore  than \\n365 days \\n0 \\nQuestion  12  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  According  to  question  22  of  the  consolidated \\nreporting template, AIFMs must  indicate the inception date of the AIF. What does inception \\ndate mean? \\nAnswer 12: If an AIF is subject to pre-authorisation, the inception date should be the date of \\nauthorisation. If an AIF is established without pre-authorisation by the competent authority, the \\ninception date should be the date when the AIF was established. Finally, if the AIF is subject \\nto  registration  obligation  at  national  level  with  its  competent  authority  after  the  date  of \\nestablishment, the inception date should be the date when the AIF was constituted. \\n                                                \\n12 \\nhttp://mifiddatabase.esma.europa.eu/Index.aspx?sectionlinks_id=23&language=0&pageName=REGULATED_MARKETS_Displ\\nay  \\n13 http://mifiddatabase.esma.europa.eu/Index.aspx?sectionlinks_id=22&language=0&pageName=MTF_Display \\n \\n13 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 13 [last update 25 March 2014]: Should AIFMs report the information in English or \\nin the language of the jurisdiction to which they report?  \\nAnswer 13: Apart from the sections on assumptions and stress tests, where text is allowed, \\nthe rest of the information to be reported will consist of figures, predetermined values or names \\nof  counterparties.  For  assumptions  and  stress  tests,  ESMA  recommends  that  the  national \\ncompetent  authority  allow  AIFMs  to  report  the  information  in  English,  which  would  allow \\nmultinational  groups  to  centralise  and  harmonise  their  AIFMD  reporting.  However,  this  will \\ndepend on the national legislation transposing the AIFMD. \\nQuestion 14 [last update 25 March 2014]: There are predetermined codes for the XML filing. \\nShould these codes be translated into national languages? \\nAnswer 14: No. These codes are predetermined values that cannot be changed for the XML \\nfiling. \\nQuestion  15 [last  update  25 March  2014]: Is  cash  resulting from  repurchase  agreements \\nincluded in the amount of cash and cash equivalents to be reported by AIFMs under questions \\n121 -124? \\nAnswer  15:  Yes. When  reporting  information  on  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  AIFMs  should \\ninclude all amounts of cash held, including as a result of repurchase arrangements. \\nQuestion  16  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  According  to  questions  163  and  164  of  the \\nconsolidated  reporting  template,  AIFMs  should  report  the  BIC  and  LEI  of  the  five  biggest \\ncounterparties to which an AIF has exposure. How should AIFMs identify those counterparties \\nif they do not have such codes?  \\nAnswer 16: In that case, AIFMs should only report the full name of the counterparty. \\nQuestion 17 [last update 25 March 2014]: What information should AIFMs report for question \\n137  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  when  they  do  not  have  an  expected  annual \\nreturn/IRR in normal market conditions?  \\nAnswer 17: In that case, AIFMs should report the value ‘N/A’ for non-applicable. \\nQuestion 18 [last update 25 March 2014]: Must all AIFMs answer questions 296 to 301 of \\nthe consolidated reporting template? \\nAnswer 18: No. Only AIFMs managing AIFs employing leverage on a substantive basis must \\nanswer questions 296 to 301 of the consolidated reporting template. \\nQuestion  19  [last  update  27  June  2014]:  Pursuant  to  questions  19  of  the  consolidated \\nreporting template for AIF-specific information and 20 of the consolidated reporting template \\n14 \\n \\n \\n \\nfor AIFM-specific information, AIFMs must specify whether the AIFs and the AIFMs are EEA \\nAIFs and EEA AIFMs. Which countries are covered by the reference to “EEA”? \\nAnswer 19: EEA AIFs and EEA AIFMs should be understood as AIFs and AIFMs established \\nin one of the 28 EU Member States or Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. \\nQuestion  20 [last  update  27  June  2014]:  According  to  Article  24(2)  of the  AIFMD,  AIFMs \\nmust report specific information for all EU AIFs they manage or AIFs they market in the Union. \\nWhich countries are covered by the reference to “the Union”? \\nAnswer 20: The reference to the Union should be understood as including the 28 EU Member \\nStates and, once the AIFMD has been incorporated into the EEA agreement, Norway, Iceland \\nand Liechtenstein. \\nQuestion  21  [last  update  27  June  2014]:  The  technical  guidance  indicates  for  each \\ninformation  item  whether  the  information  is  mandatory  (M),  optional  (O)  or  conditional  (C). \\nWhat do these categories mean?  \\nAnswer 21: Information marked as mandatory should be reported by all AIFMs. Information \\nmarked  as  optional  has  to  be  reported  if  the  AIFM  has  information  to  report.  For  example, \\nquestion 10 of the reporting template (change in AIF reporting obligation frequency code) is \\nmarked as optional. This means that AIFMs should report this information if the reporting code \\nhas changed compared to the previous reporting. Information marked as conditional is linked \\nto other information (flags) in the reporting template. If those flags are answered with “Yes”, \\nthe  corresponding  conditional  information  has  to  be  reported.  However,  if  those  flags  are \\nanswered  with  “No”,  the  corresponding  conditional  information  should  not  be  reported.  For \\nexample, if the question 41 (master feeder flag) is answered with “Yes”, AIFMs should indicate \\nin field 42 the name of the master AIFs. \\nQuestion 22 [last update 21 July 2014]: How should AIFMs calculate the percentage of trade \\nvolumes  for  derivatives  cleared  by  a  CCP  and  bilaterally  (questions  152  and  153  of  the \\nconsolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer  22:  AIFMs  should  take  into  account  the  total  number  of  trades  and  report  the \\npercentage of number of trades cleared by a CCP and bilaterally. The total should equal 100%. \\nQuestion  23  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  percentage  of \\nmarket value for repo trades cleared by a CCP, bilaterally or on a tri-party basis (questions 154 \\nand 156 of the consolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer  23:  AIFMs  should  aggregate  the  market  value  of  all  repo  trades  and  report  the \\npercentage of the market value of repo trades cleared by a CCP, bilaterally or on a tri-party \\nbasis. The total should equal 100%. \\nQuestion 24 [last update 21 July 2014]: How should AIFMs classify FX spot trades when \\nanswering questions such as on individual exposures (questions 121 to 124 of the consolidated \\nreporting template for AIF-specific information) or value of turnover in each asset class over \\n15 \\nthe  reporting  period  (questions  125  to  127  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  for  AIF-\\nspecific information)? \\n \\n \\n \\nAnswer 24: When reporting information other than value of turnover, AIFMs should classify \\nFX spot trades as ‘other cash equivalent (excluding government securities)’ with the sub-asset \\ntype code ‘SEC_CSH_OTHC’. When reporting information on value of turnover, AIFMs should \\nclassify  FX  spot \\nthe  sub-asset  type  code \\n‘SEC_CSH_CSH’. \\n‘other  cash  equivalent’  with \\ntrades  as \\nQuestion 25 [last update 21 July 2014]: AIFMs have to report value of turnover in each asset \\nclass over the reporting period (questions 125 to 127 of the consolidated reporting template \\nfor AIF-specific information). What information should AIFMs report for these questions when \\nno trades took place during the reporting period? \\nAnswer  25:  AIFMs  should  use  the  field  ‘total  other’  with  the  sub-asset  type  code \\n‘OTH_OTH_OTH’ and report ‘0’.  \\nQuestion 26 [last update 21 July 2014]: How should AIFMs classify cross-currency interest \\nswaps  when  answering  questions  such  as  those  on  individual  exposures  (questions  121  to \\n124 of the consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information) or value of turnover in \\neach asset class over the reporting period (questions 125 to 127 of the consolidated reporting \\ntemplate for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer 26: When reporting information other than value of turnover, AIFMs should classify \\ncross-currency  interest  swaps  as  ‘interest  rate  derivatives’  with  the  sub-asset  type  code \\n‘DER_IRD_INTR’.  When  reporting  information  on  value  of  turnover,  AIFMs  should  classify \\ncross-currency  interest  swaps  as  ‘interest  rate  derivatives’  with  the  sub-asset  type  code \\n‘DER_IRD_IRD’. \\nQuestion 27 [last update 11 November 2014]: When answering questions 148 and 149 of \\nthe  consolidated  reporting  template,  should  AIFMs  include  repo  and  reverse  repurchase \\nagreements? \\nAnswer 27: Yes, but AIFMs should only include securities received by the AIFs. \\nQuestion  28  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs managing  AIFs  holding  cash \\nreport the breakdown of investment strategies? \\nAnswer 28: When the holding of cash is part of a strategy such as a CTA14 strategy, AIFMs \\nshould not report cash separately. For example, an AIF with a CTA strategy representing 70% \\nof its NAV, out of which 30% of the NAV is made up of cash at the time of the reporting date, \\nshould allocate 70% of its NAV to the CTA strategy. \\n                                                \\n14 A commodity trading advisor (CTA) generally acts as an asset manager, following a set of investment strategies utilizing futures \\ncontracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of underlying instruments. \\n16 \\n \\n \\n \\nIf  the  holding  of  cash  is  not  part  of  an  investment  strategy,  AIFMs  should  use  the  strategy \\n‘other’ of the predominant AIF type selected and report the corresponding percentage of the \\nNAV held in cash. AIFMs should also use the field ‘description’ to make it clear that the field \\n‘other’ is made up of cash. \\nQuestion 29 [last update 21 July 2014]: Question 6 above clarifies that negative values can \\nbe  reported  for  investment  strategies.  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on  investment \\nstrategies with negative values? \\nAnswer 29: AIFMs should allocate the status of predominant AIF type to the strategy with the \\nhighest absolute percentage of the NAV. The predominant AIF type ‘multi-strategy hedge fund’ \\nshould be used when no strategy has an absolute value greater than 50% of the NAV. \\nQuestion 30 [last update 21 July 2014]: Should AIFMs consider bank overdrafts as funding \\nsources? \\nAnswer 30: Yes. \\nQuestion  31  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  Pursuant  to  Article  111  of  the  implementing \\nRegulation,  leverage  shall  be  considered  to  be  employed  on  a  substantial  basis  when  the \\nexposure of an AIF, as calculated according to the commitment method, exceeds three times \\nits NAV. How should AIFMs assess this limit?  \\nAnswer 31: AIFs should be considered as employing leverage on a substantial basis if, over \\nthe reporting period, the average daily calculation of the exposure as calculated according to \\nthe commitment method exceeds three times the average daily calculation of the NAV. If the \\nexposure  is  calculated  less  frequently  than  daily,  AIFs  should  be  considered  as  employing \\nleverage on a substantial basis where, at least once during the reporting period, the exposure \\nas calculated according to the commitment method exceeds three times its NAV. \\nQuestion  32  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  managing  AIFs  with  multiple \\nshare classes identify the AIFs? \\nAnswer 32: AIFMs reporting information for AIFs with multiple share classes should answer \\nquestions 24 and questions 30 to 40 of the consolidated reporting template.  \\nFor  AIFs  with  only  one  share  class,  AIFMs  should  only  answer  questions  24  to  33  of  the \\nconsolidated reporting template. \\nQuestion  33  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  In  question  282  of  the  consolidated  reporting \\ntemplate, should AIFMs report the percentage of collateral posted to all counterparties that has \\nbeen re-hypothecated as of the last business day of the reporting period or during the reporting \\nperiod? \\nAnswer 33: AIFMs should report the percentage of the market value of the collateral that has \\nbeen re-hypothecated during the reporting period. This percentage should be the ratio of the \\naggregated market value of the collateral re-hypothecated during the reporting period by all \\n17 \\n \\n \\n \\ncounterparties over the aggregated market value of all the collateral posted by AIFMs to all \\ncounterparties.  \\nQuestion  34  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  What  information  should  AIFMs  report  under \\nquestions 283 to 286 of the consolidated reporting template? \\nAnswer 34: For questions 283, 284, 285 and 286, AIFMs should aggregate the market value \\nof cash and securities borrowed. \\nQuestion 35 [last update 21 July 2014]: In which currency should AIFMs report information \\non the five principal markets and five principal instruments in which they trade (questions 29 \\nand 32 of the consolidated reporting template for AIFM-specific information)? \\nAnswer 35: AIFMs should report this information in Euro. \\nQuestion 36 [last update 30 September 2014]: A non-EU AIFM markets its AIFs in the Union \\nunder Article 42 of the AIFMD. Should the AIFM continue to report to the national competent \\nauthorities of the Member States in which it markets its AIFs after the marketing period of the \\nAIF has ended? \\nAnswer  36:  For  non-EU  AIFMs  marketing  their  AIFs  in  the  Union  under  Article  42  of  the \\nAIFMD,  the  reporting  obligations  to  national  competent  authorities  does  not  depend  on  the \\nactual marketing period of the AIF but rather on the existence of investors in the AIF in the \\njurisdiction of the authority concerned. \\nTherefore, non-EU AIFMs should continue to report to national competent authorities after the \\nmarketing  period  has  ended  unless  they  confirm  that  no  investors  in  the  jurisdiction  of  the \\nauthority concerned are invested in the AIFs. \\nQuestion  37  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  A  non-EU  AIFM  markets  its  AIFs  in  several \\nMember States under Article 42 of the AIFMD. Should the AIFM calculate a reporting frequency \\nfor  each  Member  State  where  it  markets  its  AIFs  or  should  the  AIFM  calculate  a  unique \\nreporting frequency for all Member States in which it markets its AIFs? \\nAnswer 37: According to Article 110 of the implementing Regulation, AIFMs shall take into \\naccount  all  the  EU  AIFs  they  manage  and  AIFs  they  market  in  the  Union  to  calculate  the \\nreporting frequency. The AIFM should therefore calculate a unique reporting frequency taking \\ninto account all the AIFs it markets in the Union and apply the same reporting frequency to all \\nMember States where it markets its AIFs.  \\nSimilarly, the assets under management in questions 33 and 34 of the consolidated reporting \\ntemplate for AIFM-specific information should be based on all the AIFs marketed in the Union \\nby a non-EU AIFM and not on the AIFs marketed by a non-EU AIFM in a particular Member \\nState.  This  means  that  non-EU  AIFMs  should  report  the  same  amount  of  assets  under \\nmanagement to all NCAs to which they report under Article 42 of the AIFMD. \\n18 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 38 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should AIFMs use the NAV when they report \\ninformation under questions 48 and 86 to 93 of the consolidated reporting template for AIF-\\nspecific information? \\nAnswer 38: No. AIFMs should use the total value of assets under management calculated in \\naccordance with Article 2 of the implementing Regulation. In addition, if the national competent \\nauthorities  to  which  they  report  have  decided  to  apply  ESMA’s  opinion  on  collection  of \\ninformation  under  Article  24(5),  AIFMs  should  also  use  the  total  value  of  assets  under \\nmanagement  for  questions  86  to  93  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  for  AIF-specific \\ninformation. \\nQuestion 39 [last update 30 September 2014]: How should AIFMs calculate the value of the \\nfive  main  instruments  in  which  the  AIF  is  trading (question  76  of the consolidated  reporting \\ntemplate for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer  39:  AIFMs  should  calculate  the  values  according  to  Article  2  of  the  implementing \\nRegulation  and  not  according  to  Article  3  of  the  AIFMD  as  stated  in  Annex  IV  of  the \\nimplementing Regulation. \\nQuestion 40 [last update 30 September 2014]: According to Article 110 of the implementing \\nRegulation, AIFMs shall report to national competent authorities no later than 30 days or 45 \\ndays for fund of funds after the end of the reporting period. What should AIFMs do if the final \\nNAV  of  the  AIFs  for  which  they  report  is  not  available  by  this  deadline  or  is  no  longer \\nrepresentative? \\nAnswer 40: In that situation, AIFMs should use estimates of the NAV of the AIFs and send \\nupdates afterwards if there is a difference between the estimated NAV and the final NAV. \\nQuestion 41 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should the position type (Long or Short) in \\nrelation to a derivative instrument be determined by reference to the derivative contract or by \\nreference to the exposure to the underlying of the derivative instrument (questions 75, 97, 105, \\n123, 124, 129 and 130 of consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)?  \\nAnswer  41:  The  position  type  should  be  determined  by  reference  to  the  exposure  to  the \\nunderlying of the derivative instrument. As a result, a long position on a put option should be \\nreported as ‘Short’ whereas a short position on a put option should be reported as ‘Long’. \\nQuestion  42  [last  update  30  September  2014]:  Should  AIFMs  take  into  account  the \\nsettlement period when they report information on portfolio liquidity (questions 178 to 184 of \\nthe consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer 42: AIFMs should adopt a conservative approach when they report information on the \\nportfolio liquidity. As a consequence, AIFMs should take into account the time delay for having \\nthe proceeds of the sale available on a cash account if it has as a non-negligible impact on the \\nliquidity profile of the AIF. \\n19 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 43 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should AIFMs include cash accounts when \\nreporting information on the total number of open positions (question 218 of the consolidated \\nreporting template for AIF specific information)? \\nAnswer 43: Yes, AIFMs should take into account all cash accounts that exist.  \\nQuestion  44  [last  update  30  September  2014]:  What  value  should  AIFMs  use  to  report \\ninformation  on  the  value  of  securities  borrowed  for  short  positions  (question  289  of  the \\nconsolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer 44: AIFMs should use the market value of the securities borrowed. \\nQuestion 45 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should AIFMs report information on turnover \\nof financial derivative instruments based on both market values and notional values (questions \\n126 and 127 of the consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer 45: Yes. \\nQuestion 46 [last update 30 September 2014]: How should AIFMs treat bank overdrafts for \\nthe purpose of information on individual exposures (questions 123 and 124 of the consolidated \\nreporting template)? \\nAnswer  46:  AIFMs  should  treat  bank  overdrafts  as  short  positions  in  ‘Cash  and  Cash \\nEquivalent’. \\nQuestion 47 [last update 11 November 2014]: AIFMs shall report the value of collateral and \\nother  credit  support  posted  to  all  counterparties  (questions  157  to  159  of  the  consolidated \\nreporting  template).  Should  AIFMs  include  collateral  passed  to  a  clearing  member  for \\ntransmission to a CCP in these questions? \\nAnswer 47: Yes. \\nQuestion  48  [last  update  11  November  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  turnover \\nexpressed  in  notional  value  for  derivative  instruments  (question  127  of  the  consolidated \\nreporting template)? \\nAnswer 48: AIFMs should convert the derivative positions into an equivalent position in the \\nunderlying  assets  as  prescribed  in  Article  10  and  Annex  II  of  the  implementing  Regulation \\nusing the value at the date of the trade and not at the reporting date. \\nQuestion 49 [last update 11 November 2014]: In which categories should AIFMs allocate \\nsovereign bonds which fall in the categories ‘Non-G10 with 0-1 year/1year+ term to maturity’ \\nand also in the categories ‘EU bonds with 0-1 year/1 year + term to maturity’? \\nAnswer 49: AIFMs should allocate those sovereign bonds to the categories ‘EU bonds with 0-\\n1 year/1 year + term to maturity’. \\n20 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion  50  [last  update  9  January  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on \\nsubscriptions  and  redemptions  over  the  reporting  period  (questions  255  to  278  of  the \\nconsolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 50: AIFMs should report the value of subscription and redemption orders and not the \\nnumber of subscription and redemption orders. Information should be reported for the month \\nof the cash-flows and not for the month of the subscription and redemption orders unless it is \\nthe same month. \\nFor  example,  an  AIFM  is  subject  to  quarterly  reporting  obligations  and  investors  can \\nsubscribe/redeem 4 times per year on the NAVs of 31/03, 30/06, 30/09 and 31/12 of each year. \\nThe AIFM receives for January 100 redemption orders, for February 200 redemption orders \\nand for March 50 redemption orders (350 redemption orders in total over the reporting period \\nQ1). Redemption orders are executed in April on the NAV calculated on 31 March. The NAV \\nis €100 per share. Therefore, the AIFM will report redemption orders for a total value of €35,000 \\n(350*100) in April (reporting for Q2).  \\nQuestion  51  [last  update  9  January  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on  the \\nchange in NAV per month (questions 243 to 254 of the consolidated reporting template)?  \\nAnswer  51:  The  change  in  NAV  captures  both  the  change  due  to  subscriptions  and \\nredemptions and the change due to investment performance. It is the net effect on the fund’s \\nNAV over the given reporting period after all inflows, outflows and performance are taken into \\naccount. AIFMs should report information on the change in NAV for each month of the reporting \\nperiod. If no official NAV is available for the calculation,  AIFMs should use estimates of the \\nNAV. In some cases (e.g. for AIFs investing in illiquid assets), the best estimate may be the \\nprevious NAV. \\nQuestion  52  [last  update  9  January  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on  the \\npercentage  of  gross  and  net  investment  returns  per  month  (questions  219  to  242  of  the \\nconsolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 52: AIFMs should report the information for each month of the reporting period. If no \\nofficial NAV is available for the calculation, AIFMs should use estimates of the NAV. In some \\ncases (e.g. for AIFs investing in illiquid assets), the best estimate may be the previous NAV. \\nQuestion 53 [last update 9 January 2015]: An AIFM manages both funds and funds of funds. \\nWhen should the AIFM report aggregated information at the level of the AIFM (AIFM file of the \\nconsolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 53: In that case, the AIFM should report aggregated information at the level of the \\nAIFM  and  on  funds  of  funds  no  later  than  45  days  after  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. \\nInformation on AIFs that do not take the form of fund of funds should be reported 1 month after \\nthe end of the reporting period as required by Article 110 of the implementing Regulation. \\n21 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 54 [last update 26 March 2015]: How should AIFMs report information on the total \\nlong  and  short  value  of  exposures  before  currency  hedging  (questions  128  to  130  of  the \\nconsolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 54: AIFMs should report information on long and short value of exposures for all the \\nsub-asset  types  of  questions  122  to  124  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template.  The \\ninformation should be provided in the base currency of the AIF. This means that the sum of \\nthe short and long value of exposures in questions 129 and 130 should equal the sum of the \\nquestions 122 to 124. \\nQuestion 55 [last update 26 March 2015]: Should non-EU AIFMs marketing their AIFs in the \\nUnion under Article 42 of the AIFMD report the results of stress tests under Articles 15 and 16 \\nof the AIFMD (questions 279 and 280 of the consolidated reporting template)?  \\nAnswer 55: Non-EU AIFMs marketing their AIFs in the Union under Article 42 of the AIFMD \\nshould  report  the  results  of  stress  tests  insofar  as  this  is  required  by  the  national  private \\nplacement regime of the Member States where they market their AIFs or if the non-EU AIFMs \\nhave carried out such stress tests. \\nQuestion 56 [last update 12 May 2015]: How do the reporting obligations apply to AIFMs that \\nare sister companies and that are owned by another AIFM? \\nAnswer 56: The reporting obligations apply to each individual AIFM for the AIFs they manage \\nand/or  market  in  the  Union.  This  means  that  each  AIFM  should  report  individually  to  the \\ncompetent authorities of their home Member State according to their own reporting frequency \\nas calculated pursuant to Article 110 of the implementing Regulation.  \\nQuestion  57  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  consider  commitments  or  actual \\ncapital drawdowns when they report information on subscriptions over the reporting period for \\nAIFs  pursuing  private  equity  strategies  (questions  255  to  266  of  the  consolidated  reporting \\ntemplate)? \\nAnswer 57: AIFMs should consider actual capital drawdowns and not commitments when they \\nreport information on subscriptions for AIFs pursuing private equity strategies.  \\nQuestion 58 [last update 12 May 2015]: What are the reporting obligations for a registered \\nAIFM that decides to opt in under the Directive? \\nAnswer 58: Once a registered AIFM has opted in under the Directive it has to comply with the \\nDirective  in  its  entirety.  Therefore,  an  AIFM  that  has  opted  in  has  to  report  to  its  national \\ncompetent authorities the information listed in Article 24 of the Directive. However, the fact that \\nthe  AIFM  has  opted  into  the  Directive  does  not  impact the  reporting frequency.  Indeed,  the \\nAIFM should continue to report on an annual basis to its national competent authorities.  \\nHowever, if at a later stage the total value of assets under management of the AIFM that has \\nopted in exceeds the thresholds of Article 110 of the implementing Regulation, the AIFM will \\nhave to report on a more frequent basis to its national competent authorities. \\n22 \\n \\n \\n \\nIn certain Member States, all AIFMs have to be authorised under the Directive. Therefore, in \\nthese  jurisdictions,  AIFMs  whose  total  value  of  assets  under  management  is  under  the \\nthresholds of Article 3(2)(a) and (b) of the Directive have to report to their national competent \\nauthorities the information listed in Article 24 of the Directive. \\nQuestion 59 [last update 12 May 2015]: What information should a non-EU AIFM whose total \\nvalue of assets under management does not exceed the thresholds of Article 3(2)(a) and (b) \\nof  the  Directive  and  that  markets  its  AIFs  in  the  Union  under  a  national  private  placement \\nregime report to the competent authorities?  \\nAnswer 59: Article 3 of the AIFMD does not make any distinction between EU AIFMs and non-\\nEU AIFMs. Therefore, non-EU AIFMs whose total value of assets under management does \\nnot  exceed  the thresholds  of Article  3(2)(a)  and  (b)  and  that market  their  AIFs  in  the  Union \\nunder a national private placement regime should at least report to the competent authorities \\nwhere they market their AIFs the information listed in Article 3(3)(d) of the Directive. Indeed, \\nthe national private placement regimes of the Member States where the non-EU AIFM markets \\nits AIFs may require non-EU AIFMs to report additional information. \\nQuestion  60  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  What  information  should  an  AIFM  report  for \\nquestions 128 to 130 of the consolidated reporting template when an AIF invests exclusively \\nin assets denominated in the base currency of the AIF? \\nAnswer 60: The AIFM should report the long and short positions in the base currency of the \\nAIF. \\nQuestion 61 [last update 12 May 2015]: Should AIFMs consider distribution of dividends to \\ninvestors as redemptions for the purpose of questions 267 to 278 of the consolidated reporting \\ntemplate? \\nAnswer 61: No. \\nQuestion  62  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  always  apply  the  same  reporting \\nfrequency to AIFs that are sub-funds of the same umbrella AIFs? \\nAnswer 62: No. The reporting frequency of an AIF is not affected by the legal structure of the \\nAIF. Each AIF, being sub-funds of the same umbrella AIFs or not, has to be treated separately \\nfor the purpose of the reporting obligations (including for the reporting frequency).  \\nQuestion  63  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  take  into  account  cash  and  cash \\nequivalents for the purpose of the main instruments in which the AIF is trading (questions 64 \\nto 77 of the consolidated reporting template), the principal exposures of the AIF (questions 94 \\nto  102  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template)  and  the  five  most  important  portfolio \\nconcentrations (questions 103 to 112 of the consolidated reporting template)? \\nAnswer 63: Yes. \\n23 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 64 [last update 12 May 2015]: What should be the procedure for the first reporting \\non AIFs? \\nAnswer 64: The procedure should be the same procedure as for the first reporting on AIFMs. \\nThis procedure is detailed in paragraphs 11 to 13 of ESMA’s guidelines on reporting obligations \\nunder Articles 3(3)(d) and 24 (1), (2) and (4) of the AIFMD. \\nQuestion 65 [last update July  2017]: How should AIFMs convert the total value of assets \\nunder management into Euro? \\nAnswer 65: First of all, AIFMs should use the rounded values of the AIFs in the base currency \\nof the AIFs. Then, AIFMs should divide these rounded values by the corresponding rate of one \\nunit of the base currency in Euros. For example, if the base currency of an AIF, reporting for \\n31 March 2015, is the US dollar and is using the ECB rate, AIFMs should multiply the rounded \\nvalue in US dollar of the AIF by 0.9312, which was the spot rate on that date.  \\nAIFMs should report the rounded values in Euro and in the base currency in questions 33 and \\n34 of the consolidated reporting template for AIFM-specific information and in question 48 in \\nEuro  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  for  AIF-specific  information.  AIFMs  should  also \\nreport the value of the exchange rate used for the conversion in question 37 of the consolidated \\nreporting  template  for  AIFM-specific  information  and  in  question  50  of  the  consolidated \\nreporting template for AIF-specific information. \\nQuestion 66 [last update 21 July 2015]: Question 64 above clarifies that the procedure for \\nfirst reporting of AIFs should be the same procedure as for first reporting of AIFMs as laid down \\nin ESMA’s guidelines on reporting obligations. This means that AIFMs should not report any \\ninformation  on  AIFs  for  the  reporting  period  during  which  the  AIFs  were  created.  However, \\nshould AIFMs include AIFs created during the reporting period in the total value of assets under \\nmanagement of the AIFM for that reporting period? \\nAnswer 66: Yes. This means that the total value of assets under management at the level of \\nthe AIFM at the reporting date (question 33 of the consolidated reporting template for AIFM-\\nspecific information) will not be the sum of the values of assets under management of the AIFs \\nreported for that reporting period. \\nQuestion 67 [last update 02 December 2015]: According to questions 54 to 56 and 210 to \\n217  of the  consolidated reporting template,  AIFMs  have  to report on the jurisdictions  of the \\nthree main funding sources (excluding units or shares of the AIF bought by investors) as well \\nas on the aggregate amount of borrowing and cash financing. Should AIFMs include all liquidity \\nthat is made available to the AIF (including the cash received in the context of securities lending \\ntransactions  and  repurchase  transactions),  unless  it  originates  from  the  payment  of \\nsubscriptions related to units or shares of the AIF bought by investors? \\nAnswer 67: Yes. \\nQuestion  68  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  According  to  questions  121  to  124  of  the \\nreporting  template  for  AIF-specific  information,  AIFMs  have  to  categorise  loans  as  either \\n24 \\n \\n \\n \\nleveraged or other loans. ESMA guidelines provide that where a loan is syndicated the loan \\nshould be classified as ‘other’. How should a leveraged syndicated loan be classified for the \\npurpose of completion of these questions? \\nAnswer  68:  To  ensure  consistency  of  reporting  all  leveraged  loans,  whether  syndicated  or \\notherwise, should be disclosed as leveraged loans. \\nQuestion 69 [last update 02 December 2015]: According to question 285 of the reporting \\ntemplate for AIF-specific information, AIFMs shall report information on collateralised/secured \\ncash borrowing – via (reverse) repo. Should AIFMs report cash from repurchase agreements \\nas cash borrowings? \\nAnswer 69: Yes. \\nQuestion 70 [last update 02 December 2015]: Question 66 clarifies that newly created AIFs \\nshould  be  included  in  the  total  AUM  of  the  AIFM  at  the  reporting  date  (question  33  of  the \\nreporting template for AIFM-specific information). Should information on newly created AIFs \\nalso be included in questions 26 to 32 of the reporting template for AIF-specific information? \\nAnswer 70: No. Information on the newly created AIF(s) should only be included in the total \\nAUM  of  the  AIFM  as  reported  at  question  33  of  the  reporting  template  for  AIFM-specific \\ninformation. \\nQuestion 71 [last update 02 December 2015]: According to Article 2(4) of the implementing \\nRegulation, AIFMs may exclude investments of AIFs in other AIFs they manage for the purpose \\nof  calculating  the  total  value  of  assets  under  management.  Does  ESMA  expect  AIFMs  to \\nexclude such investments from the calculation of the total value of assets under management? \\nAnswer  71:  Yes.  In  order  to  ensure  the  comparability  of  the  results  at  an  EU  level,  it  is \\nimportant  that  AIFMs  calculate  their  total  value  of  assets  under  management  in  the  same \\nmanner. In situations where feeder AIFs invest in master AIFs and where these are managed \\nby  the  same  AIFM,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  duplication  of  assets  under \\nmanagement. \\nQuestion  72  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  When  reporting  information  on  their \\ninvestment strategies, should AIFMs report the investment strategy that corresponds to their \\nportfolio of assets as at the reporting date or should they indicate the investment strategy that \\nis disclosed to investors in the fund rules or other offering documents?  \\nAnswer 72: AIFMs should report the investment strategy that is disclosed to investors in the \\nfund rules or other offering documents. \\nQuestion  73  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  determine  the \\ngeographical focus of assets in which they invest such as stocks, bonds or financial derivatives \\n(questions 78 to 85 of the consolidated template for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer 73: AIFMs should take into account the domicile of the company/entity to which the \\nAIFs have an exposure. For example, if an AIF invests in a stock of a company domiciled in \\n25 \\n \\n \\n \\nEurope but traded in the US, the corresponding geographical area would be Europe and not \\nNorth-America. Similarly, an AIF that invest in a bond issued in the US market by a company \\ndomiciled  in  the  Europe  should  select  Europe.  For  financial  derivative  instruments  such  as \\noptions,  AIFMs  should  look  at  the  financial  instrument  underlying  the  financial  derivative \\ninstruments and apply the same approach as for stocks and bonds.  \\nQuestion 74 [last update 02 December 2015]: Is information on gross and net investment \\nreturns, change in NAV, subscriptions and redemptions mandatory or optional? \\nAnswer  74:  This  information  is  mandatory  for  Article  24(2)  AIF  reporting  contents  but,  to \\nenable  the  necessary  functional  flexibility,  it  is  classified  as  optional  from  a  technical \\nstandpoint. This information is optional from a technical standpoint because AIFMs only have \\nto report this information for the months corresponding to the reporting period for which they \\nreport. For example, an AIFM that reports on quarterly basis will report in Q2 only information \\nfor  April,  May  and  June  and  not for  January,  February  and  March.  Information  on  January, \\nFebruary and March would have been part of the report for Q1.  \\nQuestion  75  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  When  reporting  information  on  leverage, \\nshould AIFMs report a ratio or a percentage? \\nAnswer 75: AIFMs should report a percentage. \\nQuestion 76 [last update 02 December 2015]: When reporting the investment strategy of a \\nfeeder AIF, should AIFMs look through the master AIF? \\nAnswer 76: ESMA expects that in most instances, feeder AIFs will have the same investment \\nstrategy  as  the  master AIF  unless  the  investments  made by  the feeder AIF  in  other  assets \\nmake the resulting strategy different. \\nQuestion  77  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  include  master/feeder \\nstructures when answering questions 290 to 293 of the consolidated template for AIF-specific \\ninformation? \\n Answer 77: No. \\nQuestion 78 [last update 02 December 2015]: Is information on liquidity profile mandatory \\nor optional (questions 178 to 192 of the reporting template for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer 78: This information is mandatory.  \\nQuestion 79 [last update 02 December 2015]: What information should AIFMs communicate \\nwhen they report a total value of assets under management with a value of 0 at the AIFM level \\n(question  33  of  the  reporting  template  for  AIFM-specific  information)  or  at  the  AIF  level \\n(question 48 of the reporting template for AIF-specific information)? \\nAnswer 79: AIFMs should use the assumption boxes of the reporting template to explain why \\nthe total value of assets under management equals 0. For example, this may be because the \\n26 \\n \\n \\n \\nassets of the AIF have been liquidated, merged with or transferred to another AIF or because \\nthe management of the AIF has been transferred to another AIFM. \\nQuestion 80 [last update May 2017]: How should AIFMs report information on the breakdown \\nbetween retail and professional investors (questions 119 and 120 of the reporting template for \\nAIF-specific information) when this information is not available? \\nAnswer: When the information is not available, AIFMs should report ‘0’ for questions 119 and \\n120 and use the assumption boxes to indicate that the information is not available.  \\nQuestion 81 [last update July 2017]:  In a situation where an AIF purchases a loan in the \\nsecondary market, how should the AIF measure its exposure in relation to that loan? \\nAnswer:  In  this  case  the  notional  value  of  the  loan  may  overestimate  the  risk  exposure. \\nTherefore, the AIF should report the valuation of the loan, as it is reported in the calculation of \\nits  NAV.  For  example,  if  an  AIF  purchases  a  distressed  and  unlevered  loan  for  €10  cash \\n(without the use of leverage) and the notional amount of that loan (i.e. the outstanding principal) \\nwas €100, the AIF should report the amount it actually spent to acquire the loan i.e. €10, which \\ncorresponds to the maximum  potential  loss  on the  loan  transaction,  not the  AIF’s  exposure \\nwith respect to that loan which would be €100 (i.e., the notional amount of such loan). During \\nthe life of the loan, the AIF should then measure the exposure in relation to that loan using the \\nsame valuation rules as the ones used for the calculation of its NAV.    \\nQuestion 82 [last update July 2017]: In which currency should the NAV of the AIF (question \\n53 of the consolidated reporting template) be reported? \\nAnswer: AIFMs should report the NAV in the base currency of the AIF. \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection IV: Notification of AIFMs \\nDate last updated: 4 October 2018 \\nQuestion 1 [last update 27 June 2014]: May an AIFM manage an AIF in a host MS under \\nArticle 33 of the AIFMD without having identified any existing AIF in that host MS beforehand? \\nAnswer  1  [last  update  27  June  2014]:  Yes.  The  fact  that  an  AIFM  cannot  identify  a  pre-\\nexisting AIF in the host MS does not prevent an AIFM from managing an AIF in that host MS \\nunder Article 33 of the AIFMD. In practice, the creation of the first AIF in the host MS is usually \\nconditional on the AIFM having previously notified the host MS’s national competent authority \\nunder Article 33 of the AIFMD. Therefore, it may be necessary for an AIFM to first notify its \\nwish to make use of the management passport under Article 33 in order to subsequently be in \\na position to create and manage AIFs in that host MS. \\nQuestion 2 [last update 27 June 2014]: When an AIFM wishes to manage an AIF in a host \\nMS for the first time, but has not yet set up any AIF in that host MS, how should it comply with \\nthe requirement of Article 33(2)(b) of the AIFMD to identify the AIFs it intends to manage? \\nAnswer 2 [last update 27 June 2014]: If the AIFM has no prior presence in the host MS it is \\nsufficient for the AIFM to specify the types of strategy of the AIFs it intends to manage in the \\nhost MS. However, this is without prejudice to the obligation for the AIFM to communicate a \\nprogramme of operations stating the services it intends to perform in the host MS.  \\nQuestion 3 [last update 26 March 2015]: Should an AIFM that is already managing AIFs in \\na host Member State under Article 33 of the AIFMD and that wishes to manage a new AIF in \\nthat host Member State undertake a new notification under Article 33(2) of the AIFMD? \\nAnswer 3: The AIFM should not undertake a new notification under Article 33(2) of the AIFMD \\nevery time it wishes to manage a new AIF established in a given Member State. The original \\nArticle 33(2) notification should be considered valid for all the AIFs it intends to manage in that \\ngiven Member State. In such cases, an update in accordance with Article 33(6) should be sent \\nto identify each new AIF to be managed under the original Article 33(2) notification. When the \\nproposed new AIFs are of a different type from the ones specified in the original Article 33(2) \\nnotification, the AIFM should clarify this in the update submitted under Article 33(6). \\nQuestion 4 [last update June 2017]: An AIFM wants to manage AIFs domiciled in another \\nMember  State  by  way  of  the  AIF  management  passport  (Article  33  of  AIFMD).  In  the \\nprogramme  of  operations,  how  does  the  AIFM  have  to  provide  information  on  the  AIFs  it \\nintends to manage? \\nAnswer: Where specific AIFs cannot be identified at the time of the notification, the AIFs to be \\nmanaged may be identified by their investment strategy. In that regard, ESMA sees merit in \\nrelying  on  the  investment  strategies  contained  in  the  reporting  template  for  identification \\npurposes (Annex IV of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 231/2013). Where an AIFM \\n28 \\n \\n \\n \\nhas only been authorised to manage certain types of AIFs, it could also refer to the scope of \\nits authorisation to identify the funds to be managed. \\nWhere the AIFM is able to identify specific AIFs, these should be identified in the programme \\nof  operations  by  their  name  and  national  identifier (if  available). Information  on those funds \\nshould also include their investment strategies. \\nIn accordance with Article 33(6) of AIFMD, all changes to the programme of operations have \\nto be notified by the AIFM to the competent authorities in its home Member State. This includes \\nchanges to the programme of operations in cases where the AIFM intends to manage further \\nAIFs (if specified by name) or types of AIFs (if specified by investment strategy) not previously \\nlisted in that document. \\n*** NEW *** Question 5 [last update 4 October 2018]: An AIFM intends to manage an EU \\numbrella AIF on a cross-border basis by way of the AIF management passport (Article 33 of \\nAIFMD).  Does  the  AIFM  have  to  identify  all  the  compartments  of  the  umbrella  AIF  in  the \\nnotification? \\nAnswer 5 [last update 4 October 2018]: Yes. In the notification, the AIFM has to identify the \\numbrella AIF, as well as the name and investment strategy of its compartments, to facilitate \\nadministrative procedure in home and host Member States. \\nAny change in the composition of an umbrella AIF that is managed on a cross-border basis \\nhas to be notified to the competent authorities pursuant to Article 33(6) of AIFMD. \\n29 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection V: MiFID services under Article 6(4) of the AIFMD \\nDate last updated: 27 June 2014 \\nQuestion 1 [last update 27 June 2014]: Can competent authorities in a Member State other \\nthan the home Member State of an AIFM accept passport notifications for the activities of the \\nAIFM authorised under Article 6(4) of the AIFMD?  \\nAnswer 1: Yes. Article 92 of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID 2) modifies the provisions of the \\nAIFMD in order to establish that an AIFM authorised to provide the MiFID investment services \\nmentioned under Article 6(4) of the AIFMD has the right to provide these services on a cross-\\nborder basis under the authorisation granted by the competent authorities of its home Member \\nState.  \\nMember States must apply the measures referred to in Article 92 of MiFID 2 from 3 July 2015. \\nHowever, the principle of sincere cooperation set out in Article 4(3) TFEU requires the Member \\nStates to facilitate the achievement of the Union’s tasks and refrain from any measure which \\ncould  jeopardise the  attainment  of  the  Union’s  objectives.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that \\ncompetent  authorities  accept  passport  notifications  for  the  activities  of  the  AIFM  authorised \\nunder Article 6(4) of the AIFMD even before 3 July 2015. \\n \\n \\n30 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection VI: Depositaries \\nDate last updated: 16 December 2015 \\nQuestion 1 [last update 21 July 2014]: Do the cash monitoring duties apply on a look-through \\nbasis to cash accounts which are not opened in the name of the AIF/AIFM, but in the name of \\nfinancial and/ or legal structures established by the AIF or by the AIFM acting on behalf of the \\nAIF for the purposes of investing in the underlying assets and which are controlled directly or \\nindirectly by the AIF or by the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF? \\nAnswer  1:  No,  the  cash  monitoring  requirements  under  Articles  85  and  86  of  Commission \\nRegulation (EU) No 231/2013 (the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation) do not apply to cash accounts \\nopened in the name of companies in which the AIF/AIFM holds investments.  \\nQuestion 2 [last update 21 July 2014]: Is it possible for the depositary to delegate to a third \\nparty  (e.g.  an  administrator  which  is  not  an  affiliate  of  the  depositary)  the  cash  flow \\nreconciliation duties? \\nAnswer 2: No. According to the provisions of Article 21(11) of the AIFMD, the monitoring of \\nthe cash flow is an activity which cannot be delegated. For example, the depositary should not \\nrely  exclusively  on  the  reconciliation  processes  performed  by  a  third  party,  even  where  the \\ndepositary performs due diligence on those processes.  \\nIn line with the provisions of recital 42 of the AIFMD, the only delegation which is permitted in \\nrelation to the monitoring of the cash flow is that of the depositary’s supporting tasks, such as \\nadministrative  or  technical functions  performed  by  the  depositary  as  a  part  of  its  depositary \\ntasks.  \\nQuestion 3 [last update 21 July 2014]: How far down the distribution chain is the depositary \\nto reconcile subscription flows?  \\nAnswer 3: The cash monitoring duties relate to any of the cash accounts – including accounts \\nused  for  subscriptions  and  redemptions  –  referred  to  in  Article  21(7)  of  the  AIFMD  (as \\nimplemented by Articles 85 to 87 of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation): accounts opened in the \\nname of the AIF, in the name of the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF or in the name of the \\ndepositary acting on behalf of the AIF. The rules on reconciliations linked to subscriptions are \\nfurther detailed in Article 93 of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation.  \\nQuestion 4 [last update 21 July 2014]: Does the obligation to verify that the AIF and AIFM \\ncomply with applicable laws and regulations in Article 95 (a) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation \\ncover anti-money laundering rules, labour law and contracts of the AIF/AIFM with third parties \\nwhich do not relate to the asset or risk management activities? \\nAnswer 4: In general, the obligation to set up and implement appropriate procedures for the \\nverifications required under Article 95(a) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation should be linked to \\nthe requirement in Article 21(9) of the AIFMD for the depositary to ensure oversight of the AIF’s \\n31 \\n \\n \\n \\noperations. The verifications required under Article 95(a) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation are \\nmeant  to  ensure  that  the  AIF  and/or  the  AIFM  acting  on  behalf  of  the  AIF  comply  with  the \\napplicable  laws  and  regulations  applying  to  the  AIF  including  fund  rules,  instruments  of \\nincorporation (e.g. investment restrictions, leverage limits, etc.). They do not relate to the laws \\nand  regulations  applying  to  these  entities  that  do  not  have  any  direct  relation  with  the \\ninstructions of the AIFM to the depositary (e.g. the application of the remuneration rules by the \\nAIFM).  This  is  without  prejudice  to  the  depositary  voluntarily  (or  in  agreement  with  the \\nAIF/AIFM) performing more extensive verifications. \\nTherefore,  the  obligation  to  verify  that  the  AIF  and  AIFM  comply  with  applicable  laws  and \\nregulations does not cover labour law or contracts with third parties unrelated to asset or risk \\nmanagement activities.  \\nAs for the compliance with the relevant anti-money laundering rules, the contract by which the \\ndepositary is appointed shall include information on the tasks and responsibilities of the parties \\nto the contract in respect of obligations relating to the prevention of money laundering and the \\nfinancing  of  terrorism  (Article  83(1)(m))  of  the  AIFMD  Level  2  Regulation.  This  is  without \\nprejudice to the relevant anti-money laundering obligations applying to the depositary, AIF and \\nAIFM  under  the  EU  legislation  on  the  prevention  of  the  use  of  the  financial  system  for  the \\npurpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. \\nQuestion 5 [last update 21 July 2014]: Is it correct to say that where derivative contracts \\ncontain  a  netting  clause,  derivatives  should  fall  exclusively  under  the  cash  flow  monitoring \\nobligation of the depositary and that it is only in the absence of a netting clause – where the \\nAIF/AIFM gets an ownership claim for the underlying – that the depositary is in a position to \\nverify  whether  the  AIF/AIFM  has  acquired  ownership  of  the  underlying  asset  according  to \\nArticle 90(2)(c) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013? \\nAnswer 5: No. Recital 103 of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation gives examples of assets that are \\nnot  financial  instruments  to  be  held  in  custody  and  specifically  includes  \\'financial  contracts \\nsuch  as  derivatives\\'  among  these  examples.  Therefore,  these  assets  are  subject  to  the \\nobligation to verify the ownership and maintain a record according to the provisions of Article \\n90(2)(c) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation. This duty involves, inter alia, looking at the contract \\nto assess what the AIF/AIFM is entitled to.  \\nQuestion 6 [last update 21 July 2014]: Are holdings in collective investment undertakings to \\nbe held in custody or subject to record keeping? \\nAnswer 6: Unless, in accordance with applicable national law, they are only directly registered \\nwith the issuer itself or its agent, in the name of the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF \\n(in which case the provisions of Article 88(2) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation apply), units of \\ncollective investment undertakings (CIUs) should be held in custody and subject to the relevant \\nprovisions of the AIFMD.  \\n32 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion 7 [last update 21 July 2014]: Within the cash monitoring duties of a depositary, \\nwhat is the meaning of “close of business day”? \\nAnswer 7: Given that the requirements relating to the monitoring of the AIF\\'s cash flows apply \\nto  the  depositary  (Article  86  of  the  AIFMD  Level  2  Regulation), the \"close  of  business  day\" \\nshould be determined in relation to the jurisdiction where the depositary is established which, \\nfor EU AIFs, is also the home Member State of the AIF. This means that the identification of \\nsignificant cash flows referred to under Article 86(c) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation should \\nbe made with reference to the close of business day in the jurisdiction where the depositary is \\nestablished,  but  the  relevant  checks  may  be  carried  out  after  the  close  of  business  in  the \\ndepositary’s jurisdiction, typically the following business day. \\nQuestion  8  [last  update  1  October  2015]: When  assets  of  an  AIF  held  in  custody  by  the \\ndepositary  of  the  AIF  are  provided  by  that  depositary  to  a  CSD  or  a  third  country  CSD  as \\ndefined  under  Regulation  (EU)  No  909/2014  (CSDR)  in  order  to  be  held  in  custody  in \\naccordance with Article 21(8) of the AIFMD, does the CSD or third country CSD have to comply \\nwith the provisions on delegation set out under Article 21(11) of the AIFMD? \\nAnswer 8: Yes.  \\nQuestion 9 [last update 16 December 2015]: Does the depositary’s liability regime apply to \\nthose assets for which a depositary has safe-keeping duties on a look-through basis according \\nto  Articles  89(3),  first  sub-paragraph,  and  90(5),  first  sub-paragraph  of  the  AIFMD  Level  2 \\nRegulation? \\nAnswer 9: Yes. The look-through requirements under Articles 89(3), first sub-paragraph, and \\n90(5), first sub-paragraph of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation mean that the depositary has safe-\\nkeeping duties in relation to the relevant assets. The safe-keeping duties are described under \\nArticle 21(8) of the AIFMD and the depositary’s liability regime set out under Article 21(12) of \\nthe AIFMD (and the relevant implementing provisions under the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation) \\napply  to  safekeeping  activities.  This  means  that  for  financial  instruments  held  in  custody  to \\nwhich  the  look-through  requirements  under  Article  89(3),  first  sub-paragraph  of  the  AIFMD \\nLevel  2  Regulation  apply,  the  depositary  is subject  to  the  strict  liability  regime  under  Article \\n21(12),  second  sub-paragraph  of  the  AIFMD.  For  other  assets  to  which  the  look-through \\nrequirements under Article 90(5), first sub-paragraph of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation apply, \\nthe depositary is subject to the liability regime under Article 21(12), third sub-paragraph of the \\nAIFMD. \\nAccording to Articles 89(3), second sub-paragraph, and 90(5), second sub-paragraph of the \\nAIFMD  Level  2  Regulation,  the  look-through  provision  does  not  apply  to  funds  of  funds  or \\nmaster-feeder structures provided they have a depositary which safe-keeps the fund’s assets \\nappropriately. Therefore, it is only for this type of investment that the liability regime should not \\napply to the depositary of the AIF as a consequence of the fact that the depositary is not subject \\nto any safe-keeping duties in relation to those investments. \\n \\n \\n33 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection VII: Calculation of leverage \\nDate last updated: 12 May 2015 \\nQuestion 1 [last update 21 July 2014]: An AIF that is a private equity fund as referred to in \\nrecital  78  of  the  AIFMD,  controls  a  financial  structure  that  is  used  to  acquire  non-listed \\ncompanies or issuers. The financial structure raises debt to finance the acquisition of those \\nassets. When calculating the exposure of the AIF, shall the AIFM include the debt raised at the \\nlevel of the financial structure? \\nAnswer  1:  According  to  Article  6(3)  of  Regulation  231/2013,  exposure  contained  in  any \\nfinancial  or  legal  structures  controlled  by  an  AIF  shall  be  included  in  the  calculation  of  the \\nexposure  where those  structures  are  specifically  set  up  to  directly  or  indirectly  increase the \\nexposure at the level of the AIF. Therefore, debt raised by such a financial structure to finance \\nthe  acquisition  of  assets  shall  be  included  in  the  calculation  of  the  exposure  where  those \\nstructures are: (1) specifically set up to directly or indirectly increase the exposure at the level \\nof the AIF and (2) the AIF controls such a structure. If these two conditions are fulfilled, the \\ndebt raised by the financial structure is to be included in the calculation of the exposure of the \\nAIF.  \\nWhere the AIF does not have to bear losses beyond its investment in a financial structure that \\nis  used  to  acquire  non-listed  companies  or  issuers,  the  financial  structure  should  not  be \\nconsidered as having been set up to directly or indirectly increase the exposure at the level of \\nthe  AIF.  In  any  case,  these  structures  should  not  be  used  as  a  means  to  circumvent  the \\nprovisions of the AIFMD on leverage.  \\nQuestion 2 [last update 21 July 2014]: An AIF controls a financial structure that is used to \\nacquire non-listed companies or issuers. When calculating the exposure of the AIF, shall the \\nAIFM include the debt raised at the level of the non-listed companies or issuers? \\nAnswer  2:  No,  provided  that  the  AIF  does  not  have  to  bear  potential  losses  beyond  its \\ninvestment in the non-listed companies or issuers.  \\nHowever,  if  the  debt  at  the  level  of  the non-listed  companies  or  issuers exposes  the  AIF to \\npotential losses beyond its investment in those non-listed companies or issuers, the debt shall \\nbe included in the calculation of the exposure of the AIF.  \\nQuestion 3 [last update 21 July 2014]: An AIF controls a financial structure that acquires \\nnon-listed companies or issuers by raising debt. At the time of the acquisition, the non-listed \\ncompanies or issuers were not leveraged. Subsequently, the non-listed companies or issuers \\nraise debt to finance a dividend distribution enabling the financial structure to reimburse entirely \\nits acquisition debt. When calculating the exposure of the AIF, shall the AIFM include the debt \\nraised at the level of the non-listed companies or issuers? \\nAnswer  3:  No,  provided  that  the  AIF  does  not  have  to  bear  potential  losses  beyond  its \\ninvestment in the non-listed companies or issuers.  \\n34 \\n \\n \\n \\nQuestion  4  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  When  calculating  the  exposure  of  an  AIF  in \\naccordance with the gross method under Article 7(a) of the implementing Regulation, should \\nAIFMs exclude the value of all cash held in the base currency of the AIF?  \\nAnswer 4: Yes. The exclusion of cash held in the base currency of the AIF applies to cash \\nand also to cash equivalents that meet the requirements of Article 7(a) of the implementing \\nRegulation. \\nQuestion 5 [last update 12 May 2015]: Which positions should AIFMs take into account when \\ncalculating  their  exposure  under  the  commitment  approach  pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the \\nImplementing Regulation? \\nAnswer: AIFMs should take into account the absolutes value of all the positions of their AIFs \\nvalued in accordance with Article 19 of the AIFMD and the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 \\nto 9 of Article 8 of the Implementing Regulation. For derivative instruments, as required under \\nArticle 8(2)(a), AIFMs should convert each position into an equivalent position in the underlying \\nassets  using  the  methodologies  set  out  in  Article  10  (which  refers  to  Annex  II  of  the \\nimplementing  Regulation)  and  points  (4)  to  (9)  and  (14)  in  Annex  I  of  the  implementing \\nRegulation. \\n \\n \\n35 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection VIII: Delegation \\nDate last updated: 16 November 2016 \\nQuestion  1  [last  update  30  September  2014]:  An  AIFM  manages  multiple  AIFs.  When \\nassessing  whether  any delegation  of  portfolio  management  and/or  risk management  by  the \\nAIFM results in the AIFM becoming a letter-box entity as referred to in Article 20 of the AIFMD, \\nshould the assessment be made at the level of the AIFM or at the level of each AIF? \\nAnswer 1: The provisions on letter-box entities in Article 82 of the implementing Regulation \\napply in relation to the management of a particular AIF and not in relation to a group of AIFs. \\nThe assessment should therefore be carried out at the level of each individual AIF. \\nQuestion 2 [last update 16 November 2016]: Where the AIFM does not itself perform the \\nfunctions set out in Annex I of the AIFMD, does this release the AIFM from its responsibility to \\nensure compliance of the relevant function(s) with the AIFMD? \\nAnswer 2: No. Where a third party performs a function stated in Annex I of the AIFMD, this \\nfunction  should  be  considered  as  having  been  delegated  by  the  AIFM  to  the  third  party. \\nTherefore, the AIFM should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements on \\ndelegation set out in Article 20 of the AIFMD and the principle expressed in Article 5(1) of the \\nDirective according to which the single AIFM appointed for an AIF is responsible for ensuring \\ncompliance with the AIFMD. For the avoidance of doubt, this applies to all functions stated in \\npoint 1 and point 2 of Annex I of the AIFMD. \\nQuestion 3 [last update 16 November 2016]: Can an externally-managed AIF itself perform \\nthe investment management functions set out in point 1 of Annex I or functions set out in point \\n2  of  Annex  I  of  the  AIFMD  or  would  it  be  possible  that  the  external  AIFM  delegates  the \\nperformance  of  these  functions  to  the  governing  body  or  any  other  internal  resource  of  the \\nexternally-managed AIF? \\nAnswer 3: No. Externally-managed AIFs are not regulated as AIFM. The performance of the \\nfunctions  stated  in  Annex  I  of  the  AIFMD  is  only  permitted  for  AIFs  which  are  internally-\\nmanaged pursuant to Article 5(1)(b) of the AIFMD. Where the AIF appoints an external AIFM \\npursuant to Article 5(1)(a), the external AIFM is through its appointment as AIFM of the AIF \\nresponsible for providing the functions stated in Annex I of the AIFMD. The external AIFM may \\ndelegate  to  third  parties  the  task  of  carrying  out  functions  on  its  behalf  in  accordance  with \\nArticle 20 of the AIFMD. The AIF is, however, not a ‘third party’ in accordance with Article 20(1) \\nof the AIFMD. \\n \\n \\n36 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection IX: Calculation of the total value of assets under management \\nDate last updated: 3 June 2016 \\nQuestion  1  [last  update  11  November  2014]:  Should  AIFMs  include  short  derivative \\npositions in the calculation of the total value of assets under management? \\nAnswer  1:  Yes.  According  to  Article  2(3)  of  the  implementing  Regulation,  AIFMs  should \\nconvert derivative instrument positions (both long and short) into an equivalent position in the \\nunderlying assets and the absolute value of that equivalent position should then be used for \\nthe calculation of the total value of assets under management. \\nQuestion 2 [last update 21 July 2015]: Should AIFMs include short non-derivative positions \\nfor the calculation of the total value of assets under management? \\nAnswer  2:  Yes.  According  to  Article  2(1)(b)  of  the  implementing  Regulation,  AIFMs  should \\ninclude  assets  acquired  through  leverage.  Where  a  short  sale  occurs  with  assets  being \\nreceived,  AIFMs  should  include  the  assets  received  in  the  calculation  of  the  total  value  of \\nassets under management. \\nQuestion  3  [last  update  3  June  2016]:  Should  “committed  capital”  be  taken  into  account \\nwhen calculating the total value of assets under management (AuM) pursuant to Article 3(2) \\nof AIFMD and Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013? \\nAnswer 3: Generally, no. As a general rule, committed capital does not contribute to the actual \\nassets of the AIF for which it was pledged, as long as it has not been drawn down by the AIFM. \\nHowever, Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013 makes reference to national \\nvaluation  rules  as  well  as  to  rules  on  valuation  contained  in  the  AIF  rules  or  articles  of \\nincorporation. Committed capital should therefore be taken into account in the calculation of \\ntotal AUM if national rules foresee this. \\n \\n \\n37 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection X: Additional own funds \\nDate last updated: 3 June 2016 \\nQuestion  1:  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  exclude  investments  by  AIFs  in \\nother AIFs they manage for the calculation of additional own funds under Article 9(3) of the \\nAIFMD? \\nAnswer 1: Yes. \\nQuestion  2:  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  exclude  investments  by  AIFs  in \\nother AIFs they manage for the calculation of additional own funds to cover potential liability \\nrisks arising from professional negligence under Article 9(7) of the AIFMD? \\nAnswer 2: No, because investments in other AIFs managed by the same AIFM increase the \\noperational risk. \\nQuestion  3  [last  update  3  June  2016]:  Should  “committed  capital”  be  taken  into  account \\nwhen calculating the additional own funds requirement pursuant to Articles 9(3) and 9(7) of \\nAIFMD and Article 14(2) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013? \\nAnswer 3: As a general rule, committed capital does not contribute to the actual assets of the \\nAIF for which it was pledged, as long as it has not been drawn down by the AIFM. \\n \\n \\n38 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection XI: Scope \\nDate last updated: 26 March 2015 \\nQuestion 1 [last update 26 March 2015]: According to Article 36(1) of the AIFMD, Member \\nStates may allow an authorised EU AIFM to market to professional investors, in their territory \\nonly, units or shares of EU feeder AIFs which have a non-EU master AIF managed by a non-\\nEU AIFM provided that the EU AIFM managing the EU feeder AIF fulfils certain conditions as \\nset out in Article 36(1) (a) to (c). Does the non-EU AIFM managing the non-EU master AIF also \\nhave to be authorised under the AIFMD? \\nAnswer 1: According to Article 36(2) of the AIFMD, Member States may impose stricter rules \\non the AIFM in respect of the application of Article 36 of the AIFMD. Therefore, whether the \\nnon-EU  AIFM  managing  the  non-EU  master  AIFs  has  to  be  authorised  under  the  AIFMD \\ndepends on the national law of the Member State transposing Article 36 of the AIFMD. \\n \\n \\n39 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection XII: Impact of Regulation (EU) 648/2012 (EMIR)15 on AIFMD \\nDate last updated: 24 May 2017 \\nQuestion  1  [last  update  19  July  2016]:  For  OTC financial  derivative  transactions  that  are \\ncentrally  cleared  and  subject  to  the  reporting  obligation  of  EMIR,  can  AIFMs  rely  on  the \\nvaluation provided by the central counterparty (CCP)? \\nAnswer: No. The AIFMD framework requires AIFMs to have in place a process for proper and \\nindependent verification of the value of the OTC financial derivative transactions, even if they \\nare centrally cleared. The valuation provided by the CCP can only serve as a point of reference \\nfor the verification performed by the AIFM.  Nevertheless, the AIFM should be able to justify \\nany deviation from the valuation provided by the CCP. \\nQuestion  2  [last  update  May  2017]: Where  an  AIF  is  subject  to  the  clearing  obligation  of \\nArticle 4(1) of EMIR, can it make use of the exemption for intragroup transactions (Article 4(2) \\nof EMIR)? \\nAnswer: ESMA is of the view that in the case of AIFs the exemption for intragroup transactions \\nshould be construed narrowly, and that in most cases it will not be possible for the exemption \\nto be used. An AIF can only make use of the exemption for intragroup transactions if it has \\nbeen established to form part of the same group (as defined in Article 2(16) of EMIR) as the \\ncounterparty  to  the  OTC  derivative  contract  and  if  it  fulfils  all  the  criteria  for  intragroup \\ntransactions set out in Article 3(2)(a)(i)-(iv), (b), or (d) of EMIR. \\nArticle 3(2)(a)(iii) of EMIR requires both counterparties to be included in the same consolidation \\non a full basis. In addition, they have to be subject to appropriate centralised risk evaluation, \\nmeasurement and control procedures, as well as fulfil other specific requirements set out in \\nArticle 3(2) of EMIR. \\nAn exemption to the clearing obligation based on Article 4(2) of EMIR can only be granted after \\na thorough case-by-case assessment, which will have to take into account whether the AIF \\nhas been established to form part of the same group as the counterparty to the OTC derivative \\ncontract and whether the AIF fulfils all the criteria set out in Article 3(2)(a), (b), or (d) of EMIR. \\nWhere an AIF is granted an intragroup exemption for the clearing obligation, it follows that the \\nAIF will not be considered a distinct entity and will not be treated separately for other purposes \\nunder  EMIR  either,  in  particular  for  the  purpose  of  the  bilateral  margining  thresholds \\ncalculation. Therefore, the aggregate month-end average notional amount referred in Article \\n28(1) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 shall be calculated at the group \\nlevel (including the relevant AIF). \\n                                                \\n15 Regulation  (EU)  No  648/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  4  July  2012  on  OTC  derivatives,  central \\ncounterparties and trade repositories (“European Markets Infrastructure Regulation”) \\n40 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n41 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection XIII: Impact of Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 (SFTR)16 on AIFMD \\nDate last updated: 5 October 2017 \\nQuestion  1  [last  update  6  October  2016]:  Article  13  of  Regulation  (EU)  2015/2365  on \\ntransparency of securities financing transactions and of reuse and amending Regulation (EU) \\nNo 648/2012, requires UCITS management companies,  UCITS investment companies, and \\nAIFMs to provide information to investors on the use made of SFTs and total return swaps in \\nthe annual report of each UCITS/AIF under management, as well as in each half-yearly report \\nfor  UCITS.  As  Article  13  applies  from  13  January  2017,  which  report  should  be  the  first  to \\ninclude this disclosure? \\nAnswer:  The  information  should  be  included  in  the  next  annual  or  half-yearly  report  to  be \\npublished after 13 January 2017 which may relate to a reporting period beginning before that \\ndate. \\nQuestion  2  [last  update  5  October  2017]:  Pursuant  to  Article  13  of  SFTR,  UCITS \\nmanagement companies, UCITS investment companies, and AIFMs (“UCITS/AIF managers”) \\nshall inform investors on the use they make of SFTs and total return swaps in annual (UCITS \\nand  AIFs)  and  half-yearly  (UCITS  only)  reports.  The  information  on  SFTs  and  total  return \\nswaps shall include the data provided for in Section A of the Annex to SFTR. \\nShould  this  data  be  reported  as  aggregate  data  (with  respect  to  the  whole  of  the  reporting \\nperiod) or based on a snapshot (taken at the end of the reporting period)? \\nAnswer: The table below explains how each data item in Section A of the Annex to the SFTR \\nshould be reported. All data items should be reported as a snapshot, with the exception of the \\nfollowing:  \\n-  Data on reuse of collateral \\no  Cash collateral reinvestment returns to the collective investment undertaking. \\n-  Data on return and cost for each type of SFTs and total return swaps \\no  broken  down  between  the  collective  investment  undertaking,  the  manager  of \\nthe  collective  investment  undertaking  and  third  parties  (e.g.  agent  lender)  in \\nabsolute terms and as a percentage of overall returns generated by that type of \\nSFTs and total return swaps \\nFor each of the data items firms should not artificially alter their practices in a way that would \\nlead to the reporting being misleading. \\nThe guidance provided by this Q&A is without prejudice to further work that ESMA intends to \\ncarry out in relation to the disclosure obligations for UCITS and AIFs under SFTR.    \\n                                                \\n16 Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on transparency of securities \\nfinancing transactions and of reuse and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 \\n42 \\nHeading \\nSub-item \\nHow to report \\n \\n \\n \\nGlobal data \\n \\nConcentration data \\n \\nAggregate \\ntransaction \\ndata  for  each  type  of \\nSFTs  and  total  return \\nswaps  separately  to  be \\nbroken  down  according \\nto the below categories \\n \\nSnapshot \\nThe  amount  of  securities \\nand commodities on loan as \\na proportion of total lendable \\nassets defined as excluding \\ncash and cash equivalents \\nSnapshot \\nThe  amount  of  assets \\nengaged  in  each  type  of \\nSFTs and total return swaps \\nexpressed  as  an  absolute \\nthe  collective \\namount  (in \\nundertaking’s \\ninvestment \\ncurrency) \\na \\nproportion  of  the  collective \\ninvestment \\nundertaking’s \\nassets  under  management \\n(AUM). \\nand \\nas \\nSnapshot \\nSnapshot \\nTen largest collateral issuers \\nacross  all  SFTs  and  total \\nreturn swaps (break down of \\nvolumes  of \\nthe  collateral \\nsecurities  and  commodities \\nreceived per issuer’s name);  \\nTop  10  counterparties  of \\neach type of SFTs and total \\nreturn  swaps  separately \\n(Name  of  counterparty  and \\ngross volume of outstanding \\ntransactions). \\nand \\nType \\ncollateral;  \\nquality \\nof \\nSnapshot \\nof \\ntenor \\nMaturity \\nthe \\ncollateral broken down in the \\nfollowing  maturity  buckets: \\nless  than  one  day,  one  day \\nto  one  week,  one  week  to \\nSnapshot.

All SFTs have a given duration (normally short term) \\nand there may be several SFTs that are carried out on a number of occasions with repeated \\ninvestments  and  divestments  of cash.  Due  to  the  possible  concatenation  of the  operations, \\nthere may be a certain amount of cash collateral which is constantly invested for the whole \\nyear and produces a return. One interpretation is that the SFTR requires managers to disclose \\nat least the overall sum of the returns earned by the fund from all the investment operations \\nmade during the year with cash collateral. This sum may only be an income flow that covers \\nthe whole year and therefore the distinction between aggregate vs snapshot (i.e. flow vs stock \\ndata) is not meaningful, because it could be calculated in only one way. One alternative would \\nbe to state that this is  “aggregate” by definition. Another  alternative  would be to require the \\ndisclosure  of the  cash  collateral  investment return,  calculated  as the  sum  of the  cash flows \\nreceived for the investment of SFTs cash collateral over the yearly average amount of cash \\ncollateral investments.   \\nThe same reasoning applies to the field “Data on return and cost for each type of SFTs and \\ntotal return swaps/broken down between the collective investment undertaking, the manager \\nof the collective investment undertaking and third parties (e.g. agent lender) in absolute terms \\nand as a percentage of overall returns generated by that type of SFTs and total return swaps”. \\nThe manager has to sum the inflows and outflows generated by all the operations during the \\nyear and disclose the two total amounts; again, there appears to be only one way to calculate \\nthe data required and the disclosure of rate of returns (gross and net of cost) could be required \\nif deemed more appropriate. \\n45 \\n \\n \\n \\nSection XIV: Branches \\nDate last updated: July 2018 \\nQuestion 1: What are the supervisory responsibilities of competent authorities in host Member \\nStates when an alternative investment fund manager provides investment services through a \\nbranch established in the host Member State? \\nAnswer: Under both the UCITS and the AIFM Directives, supervisory powers of competent \\nauthorities in relation to branches of UCITS management companies or alternative investment \\nfund managers (AIFMs) established in a Member State that is not the home Member State are \\nshared.  The  competent  authority  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  branch  is  located  (host \\nMember State) is responsible for the supervision of the branch’s compliance with conduct rules \\nreferred  to  in  Article  17(5)  of  the  UCITS  Directive  and  Article  45(2)  of  the  AIFMD  and  the \\ncompetent authority of the Member State in which the UCITS management company or the \\nalternative investment fund manager is established (home Member State) is responsible for \\nthe supervision of the other requirements provided under the relevant applicable framework.17 \\nNeither the UCITS Directive nor the AIFMD provides for an explicit framework for the allocation \\nof  supervisory  responsibilities  and  powers  for  those  cases  where  UCITS  management \\ncompanies or AIFMs are authorised to carry out investment services set out in Article 6(3) of \\nthe UCITS Directive and Article 6(4) of the AIFMD and have branches providing those services \\nin other Member States. ESMA is of the view that responsibilities of home and host Member \\nStates  should  be  identified  similarly  to,  and  consistently  with,  the  general  framework \\nestablished  for  the  provision  of  activities  pursued  by  UCITS  management  companies  and \\nAIFMs through branches as well as with the MiFID II framework regulating the supervision on \\nthe provision of investment services across the EU. This approach is in line with the division \\nof responsibilities provided under the MiFID II framework. In accordance with Article 35(8) of \\nMiFID II, the competent authority of the host Member State has the responsibility for ensuring \\nthat  the  services  provided  by  the  branch  of  an  investment  firm  or  a  credit  institution  in  its \\nterritory  comply  with  the  MiFID  II  requirements  under  Articles  24  (“General  principles  and \\ninformation to clients”) and 25 (“Assessment of suitability and appropriateness and reporting \\nto  clients”)  of  MiFID  II,  which  also  apply  to  UCITS  management  companies  and  AIFMs \\nproviding investment services. \\n                                                \\n17 See  Article  17(4)  and  (5)  of  UCITS  Directive  and  Article  45(1)  and  (2)  of  AIFMD.
