general questions and answers blanket cancellation of orders policy updated 30 may 2017 q4 1 is a policy pursuant to which after becoming in possession of inside information the person should immediately and without the exercise of discretion cancel all orders relating to that information blanket order cancellation policy compliant with the insider dealing prohibition under mar
a4 1 article 8 1 of mar states that the use of inside information by cancelling or amending an order placed before the person concerned possessed inside information constitutes insider dealing
this presumption is rebuttable under recital 25 of mar if the person establishes that they did not use the inside information when carrying out the transaction
it follows that where a firm decides to adopt a blanket cancellation policy for its proprietary trading the fact that the cancellation may or may not constitute insider dealing will have to be assessed on case by case basis by determining whether or not the cancellation was indeed performed without using the inside information
questions and answers on the disclosure of inside information disclosure of inside information related to pillar ii requirements updated 23 march 2018 10 q5 1 are credit institutions required under mar to publish systematically the results of the pillar ii assessment and or any information received in relation to the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities mrel exercise
issuers who have requested or approved admission of their financial instruments to trading on a regulated market or in the case of instruments only traded on an mtf or on an otf issuers who have approved trading of their financial instruments on an mtf or an otf or have requested their admission to trading on an mtf must inform the public as soon as possible of any inside information relating directly to them
according to article 7 of mar inside information is such information that is non public precise and if it were made public would be likely to have a significant effect on the price of the issuer s financial instrument or related financial instruments
mar offers by way of exception to the immediate disclosure of inside information the possibility on a case by case basis to delay such disclosure under certain conditions
in accordance with article 17 4 of mar any issuer may thus delay under its own responsibility the public disclosure of inside information such as not to prejudice its legitimate interests provided that such omission is not likely to mislead the public16 and the issuer is able to ensure the confidentiality of the information
where the issuer is also a credit or financial institution article 17 5 of mar allows for another possibility to delay in exceptional circumstances the public disclosure of inside information under the issuer s responsibility in order to preserve the stability of the financial system
where such an issuer intends to delayunder article 17 5 of mar it needs the prior consent of the competent authority on the basis that the following conditions are fulfilled i the disclosure of the inside information entails a risk of undermining the financial stability of the issuer and of the financial system ii it is in the public interest to delay disclosure and iii the confidentiality of the information can be ensured
however it is not feasible to define ex ante in a general manner how the relevant conditions should be met and therefore the concerned issuer needs to assess on a case by case basis the particular circumstances before deciding to delay the disclosure of inside information under article 17 4 of mar or notifying to the competent authority its intention to delay under article 17 5 of mar
under mar an issuer can also be liable for market manipulation in case of dissemination of false and misleading information including failure to properly disclose inside information to the public
11 many credit institutions across the european union are issuers of financial instruments and thus subject to the regime established under mar when at the same time they are also subject to the prudential supervision of the banking regulators
consequently in the context of the supervisory review and evaluation process srep to be conducted in accordance with article 97 of directive 2013 36 eu crd iv whenever a credit institution subject to the market abuse regime is made aware of information notably the results of the exercise it is expected to evaluate whether that information meets the criteria of inside information
along the same line in the context of the mrel exercise to be conducted by the single resolution board in accordance with the bank recovery and resolution directive whenever a credit institution subject to the market abuse regime is made aware of information it is expected to evaluate whether that information meets the criteria of inside information
such a credit institution would have then to publicly disclose the inside information as soon as possible unless it has delayed such a disclosure after having assessed that all the conditions for delaying apply
esma recalls that if and when a publication e g an article published in the press or internet postings which is not resulting from the issuer s initiative in relation to its disclosure obligations or a rumour in the market relates explicitly to a piece of information that is inside information within the issuer according to article 17 7 of mar that issuer is expected to react and respond to the relevant publication or rumour if that piece of information is sufficiently accurate to indicate that the confidentiality of this inside information is no longer ensured
in such circumstances which should be the exception rather than the rule and should be examined by the issuer on a case by case basis a policy of staying silent or of no comment by the issuer would not be acceptable
the issuer s reaction or response should be made publicly available in the same conditions and using the same mechanisms as those used for the communication of inside information so that an ad hoc announcement has to be published without undue delay
finally it is noted that the disclosure of inside information is a matter of national supervision and enforcement of mar solely under the competence of the national competent authorities designated to that effect in accordance with article 22 of mar and whose heads are members of the board of supervisors of esma
delayed inside information that lost the feature of the price sensitivity updated 29 september 2017 q5 2 how should an issuer deal with a situation where it has delayed a disclosure of inside information in accordance with article 17 4 of mar and due to subsequent circumstances that information loses the element of price sensitivity and therefore its inside nature
12 a5 2 according to article 17 1 of mar an issuer has to inform the public as soon as possible of inside information that directly concerns that issuer
article 17 4 of mar states that an issuer may on its own responsibility delay disclosure of inside information to the public provided that all of the conditions therein contained are met
where an issuer has delayed the disclosure of inside information according to article 17 4 of mar immediately after the information is disclosed to the public the issuer needs to inform the competent authority that disclosure of inside information was delayed and provide written explanation on how the conditions set out in article 17 4 of mar were met
where the issuer has delayed the disclosure of inside information in accordance with article 17 4 of mar and the information subsequently loses the element of price sensitivity that information ceases to be inside information and thus is considered outside the scope of article 17 1 of mar
therefore the issuer is neither obliged to publicly disclose that information nor to inform the competent authority in accordance with the last paragraph of article 17 4 that disclosure of such information was delayed
however given that the information had been inside information for a certain period of time the issuer had to comply with all relevant obligations relating to the drawing up and updating of insider lists and the maintenance of the information relating to the delay of disclosure stemming from mar and its delegated and implementing regulations
delayed disclosure of inside information under article 17 5 of mar assessment of the relevant conditions updated 1 october 2018 new q5 3 when issuers that are credit financial institutions intend to delay disclosure of inside information under article 17 5 of mar what are the elements they should consider in their assessment of the conditions therein contained
a5 3 when a credit financial institution intends to resort to the financial stability delay under article 17 5 of mar it should provide evidence to the nca that the conditions laid down in points a b and c of the same article are met
the assessment of those conditions should be as complete as possible to the best of the credit financial institution s knowledge
if the nca gives its consent to the delay further to its own assessment of the relevant conditions the credit financial institution is expected to share with the nca any subsequent additional information relating to the conditions for the delay
point a of article 17 5 of mar disclosure of inside information entails a risk of undermining the financial stability of the issuer and the financial system it should be noted that to resort to the delay under article 17 5 of mar disclosure of inside information has to entail a risk of undermining the financial stability of both the issuer and the financial system
13 for the disclosure of inside information to entail a risk of undermining the stability of the financial system it is likely for it to pertain and be performed by an institution of relevance e g in terms of impact and interconnection
in this context credit financial institutions should not simply rely on ex ante categorisations but rather look at the specific circumstances
point b of article 17 5 of mar the public interest to delay the disclosure in the absence of any definition of public interest recital 52 of mar provides guidance stipulating that the wider public and economic interest in delaying disclosure outweighs the interest of the market in receiving the information which is subject to delay
when assessing the public interest the credit financial institution should attempt to identify different entities or groups who could be directly or indirectly affected by the decision to delay the disclosure of the inside information and whose interests may be understood as a public interest
during the assessment of the public interest it is important to consider interests beyond the direct economic impacts and other non financial interests of the public
if there are divergent interests of the public the credit financial institution should assess on a case by case basis if the prevailing public interest s is to delay the disclosure of inside information
for example a potential loss to investors who have made or may make an investment decision should be weighed against the adverse effect of public disclosure on other groups such as depositors and consumers
point c of article 17 5 of mar the confidentiality of the information credit financial institutions should provide the nca with information on how the confidentiality of the inside information can be ensured
credit financial institutions are expected to assess the confidentiality of the information at the time of the notification to the nca but also how the confidentiality can be ensured during the period in which the information might be delayed
to that purpose credit financial institutions should consider their procedures and measures put in place to ensure the confidentiality and draw up their insider list given that pending the nca s decision to consent to the delay the disclosure of the inside information is de facto already delayed
delayed disclosure of inside information under article 17 5 of mar notification of the expected duration updated 1 october 2018 new 14 q5 4 are credit financial institutions required to notify the nca of the expected duration of the delay under article 17 5 of mar
the credit financial institutions notifying the nca of their intention to resort to the financial stability delay are expected to provide their assessment on the expected length of the delay and the details of expected trigger events
if the nca gives its consent to the delay further to its own assessment of the relevant conditions credit financial institutions should inform the nca whenever they become aware of a new element or event that may affect the duration of the delay under article 17 5 of mar
delayed disclosure of inside information under article 17 5 of mar nca s denial of consent updated 1 october 2018 new q5 5 where the nca does not consent to the delay of disclosure under article 17 5 of mar can a credit financial institution resort to article 17 4 of mar
where the relevant conditions are not met the nca cannot consent to the delay under article 17 5 of mar and according to article 17 6 of mar the credit financial institution will have to disclose the inside information immediately
in that case credit financial institutions will not be able to resort to the delay of disclosure under article 17 4 of mar
questions and answers on the prevention and detection of market abuse persons professionally arranging or executing transactions updated 1 september 2017 q6 1 does the obligation to detect and report market abuse under article 16 2 of mar apply to investment firms under mifid only or do ucits management companies aifmd managers or firms professionally engaged in trading on own account also fall within the scope of that obligation
a6 1 the definition of person professionally arranging or executing transactions laid down in point 28 of article 3 1 of mar is activity based does not cross refer to definitions under mifid and is independent from the latter leading thus to consider that the scope of article 16 2 of mar is not only limited to firms or entities providing investment services under mifid
15 in the absence of any reference in the definition that would limit the scope and exclude particular categories of persons regulated by other financial european legislation esma considers that the obligation to detect and identify market abuse or attempted market abuse under article 16 2 of mar applies broadly and persons professionally arranging or executing transactions thus includes buy side firms such as investment management firms aifs and ucits managers as well as firms professionally engaged in trading on own account proprietary traders
non financial firms that in addition to the production of goods and or services trade on own account in financial instruments as part of their business activities e g industrial companies for hedging purposes can be considered firms professionally arranging or executing transactions in financial instruments under article 16 2 of mar
the fact that they have staff or a structure dedicated to systematically deal on own account such as a trading desk or that they execute their own orders directly on a trading venue as defined under mifid ii are indicators to consider a non financial firm as a person professionally arranging or executing transactions
it is reminded that detecting and reporting suspicious orders and transactions under article 16 2 of mar should be applied by persons professionally arranging or executing transactions through the implementation of arrangements systems and procedures that are appropriate and proportionate to the scale size and nature of their business activity 16 7
questions and answers on managers transactions exchange rate updated 26 october 2016 q7 1 for transactions carried out under article 19 1 of regulation eu no 596 2014 of the european parliament and of the council mar in a currency which is not euro eur which exchange rate should be used to determine if the threshold set forth in article 19 8 mar of eur 5 000 has been crossed
a7 1 if transactions are carried out in a currency which is not the eur the exchange rate to be used to determine if the threshold is reached is the official daily spot foreign exchange rate which is applicable at the end of the business day when the transaction is conducted
where available the daily euro foreign exchange reference rate published by the european central bank on its website should be used
timing of the closed period updated 13 july 2016 q7 2 does the announcement of the interim or year end financial results determines the timing of the closed period referred to in article 19 11 of regulation eu no 596 2014 mar
a7 2 according to mar there should be only one closed period relating to the announcement of every interim financial report and another relating to the year end report
the term announcement of an interim or a year end financial report used in article 19 11 of mar is the public statement whereby the issuer announces the information included in an interim or a year end financial report that the issuer is obliged to make public according to the rules of the trading venue where the issuer s shares are admitted to trading or national law
with particular reference to the year end financial report the announcement is the public statement whereby the issuer announces in advance to the publication of the final year end report the preliminary financial results agreed by the management body of the issuer and that will be included in that report
this can apply only if the disclosed preliminary financial results contain all the key information relating to the financial figures expected to be included in the year end report
in the event the information announced in such way changes after its publication this will not trigger another closed period but should be addressed in accordance with article 17 of mar
in any case persons discharging managerial responsibilities remain subject at all times to articles 14 and 15 of mar prohibiting insider dealing and attempted insider 17 dealing unlawful disclosure of inside information as well as market manipulation and attempted market manipulation
threshold calculation updated 20 december 2016 q7 3 when calculating whether the threshold triggering the notification obligation under article 19 1 of mar is reached 5 000 eur or 20 000 eur should the transactions carried out by a person discharging managerial responsibilities pdmr and by closely associated persons to that pdmr be aggregated
a7 3 no the transactions carried out by a pdmr and by closely associated persons to that pdmr should not be aggregated
this involves that where the overall transactions singularly carried out by either a pdmr or any closely associated person to that pdmr do not reach the threshold those persons should not notify those transactions even where the threshold is reached aggregating all the transactions carried out by the pdmr and all the closely associated persons to them
in such a case none of them has reached the 5 000 eur threshold and thus a notification is not required
price of gifts donation and inheritance updated 20 december 2016 q7 4 which are the rules to calculate the price of gifts donations and inheritance for the purpose of the notifications and disclosure of managers transactions under article 19 of mar
a7 4 according to article 10 2 k of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 522 donations and gifts made or received or inheritance received are transactions to be notified under article 19 1 of mar
the value of these transactions need to be taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating the cumulated amount of the transactions of a pdmr or a person closely associated to a pdmr to assess whether the threshold eur 5 000 or eur 20 000 referred to in article 19 8 and 9 of mar has been crossed hence triggering the duty to notify and disclose all subsequent transactions
the field 4 c on price s and volume s of the template in the annex to commission implementing regulation eu 2016 523 implementing technical standards on the notification and public disclosure of managers transactions specifies the data standards to be used for expressing the price depending on the type of financial instruments concerned
in that respect such template makes reference to data standards defined for the purpose of the transaction reporting under regulation eu 18 600 2014 mifir and related technical standards
however it does not explain the rules about the price to take into account to calculate the value of a donation a gift or inheritance
for the purpose of the threshold calculation the price to consider for donations gifts and inheritance is the last published price for the financial instrument concerned in accordance with the post trade transparency requirements under mifir articles 6 10 20 and 21 on the date of acceptance of the donation gift or inheritance i e the date of the transaction or where such price is not available that day the last published price
in the period before mifir becomes applicable the price to use will be for shares admitted to trading on regulated markets rm the last published price in accordance with the post trade transparency requirements under articles 30 and 45 of directive 2004 39 ec mifid i on the date of acceptance of the donation gift or inheritance or where such price is not available that day the last published price for shares admitted to trading or traded on mtfs only bonds and derivatives or financial instrument linked thereto the last traded price on the trading venue where the concerned financial instruments are traded on the date of acceptance of the donation gift or inheritance or where such price is not available that day the last traded price before the date of acceptance
during the interim in the case of shares being traded on several venues rms and or mtfs then the concept of most relevant markets in terms of liquidity under mifid i and specified in the commission regulation ec 1287 2006 implementing mifid i should be used to determine the trading venue to consider when looking at the last traded price
furthermore where debt instruments admitted to trading or traded on a rm or a mtf are only traded otc i e there is no trading on rm nor mtf then the price to consider should be the last publicly available price for that debt instrument whatever is the source
however when a notification has to be made in accordance with article 19 1 of mar and article 2 of the implementing technical standards on the notification and public disclosure of managers transactions the price field for a gift donation or inheritance is expected to be populated with 0 zero
notification of shares received as part of remuneration package updated 20 december 2016 q7 5 do shares received by a pdmr as part of a remuneration package have to be notified pursuant to article 19 1 mar and article 10 2 i commission regulation 2016 522 only upon the occurrence of certain conditions
19 a7 5 the rationale of article 19 1 of mar is mainly to prevent insider dealing and to provide investors with a highly valuable source of information
a notification of entering into a remuneration package contract according to which a pdmr is entitled to receive shares only upon the occurrence of certain conditions is not covered by that rationale
therefore pursuant to article 19 1 of mar and article 10 2 i of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 522 the pdmr has to notify only upon the occurrence of the conditions and the actual execution of the transaction
price of options granted for free updated 20 january 2017 q7 6 which are the rules to calculate the price of options granted for free to managers or employees for the purpose of the notifications and disclosure of managers transactions under article 19 of mar
a7 6 according to article 10 2 b of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 522 such transactions have to be notified under article 19 1 of mar
the value of these transactions needs to be taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating the cumulated amount of the transactions of a person discharging managerial responsibility pdmr or a person closely associated to a pdmr to assess whether the threshold eur 5 000 or eur 20 000 referred to in article 19 8 and 9 of mar has been crossed hence triggering the duty to notify and disclose all subsequent transactions
the field 4 c on price s and volume s of the template in annex to commission implementing regulation eu 2016 523 implementing technical standards on the notification and public disclosure of managers transactions specifies the data standard to be used for expressing the price depending on the type of financial instruments concerned
in that respect such template makes reference to data standards defined for the purpose of the transaction reporting under regulation eu 600 2014 mifir and related technical standards
however it does not explain the rules about the price to take into account to calculate the value of the received options
for the purpose of the threshold calculation the price to consider for the received options should be based on the economic value assigned to the options by the issuer when granting them
if such an economic value is not known the price to consider should be based on an option pricing model that is generally accepted in the reasonable opinion of the pdmr
this model determines the price of the granted option based on variables such as the current share price of the issuer exercise price of the option and time until expiry of the option
other variables that can be used in the option pricing model are risk free interest rates future dividends and implied volatility
the variables used for the price determination of the granted option depends on which general accepted option pricing model is used
however when a notification has to be made in accordance with article 19 1 of mar and article 2 of the implementing technical standards on the notification and public 20 disclosure of managers transactions the price field for options granted for free to managers or employees is expected to be populated with 0 zero
closely associated persons under article 3 1 26 d of mar updated 6 july 2017 q7 7 according to article 3 1 26 d of regulation eu no 596 2014 of the european parliament and of the council mar a closely associated person is inter alia a legal person trust or partnership the managerial responsibilities of which are discharged by a person discharging managerial responsibilities pdmr or by a closely associated natural person
is the reference to the managerial responsibilities of which are discharged contained in article 3 1 26 d of mar to be read in the same way as the definition of pdmr within an issuer contained in article 3 1 25 of mar
a7 7 no the reference to the managerial responsibilities of which are discharged in article 3 1 26 d of mar should be read to cover those cases where a pdmr within an issuer or a closely associated natural person takes part in or influences the decisions of another legal person trust or partnership hereinafter legal entity to carry out transactions in financial instruments of the issuer
for example in the case of mere cross board membership where a person sits in the administrative management or supervisory body of an issuer and also in the board of another legal entity where they exercise executive or non executive functions without however taking part nor influencing the decisions of that legal entity to carry out transactions in financial instruments of the issuer then that person should not be considered discharging managerial responsibilities within that legal entity for the purposes of article 3 1 26 d of mar
therefore that legal entity should not be subject to the notification obligations under article 19 1 of mar unless it is directly or indirectly controlled by is set up for the benefit of or its economic interests are substantially equivalent to those of that person
trading during closed periods and prohibition of insider dealing updated 21 november 2017 q7 8 how should permission to trade in a closed period which may be granted in certain circumstances to pdrms in accordance with article 19 12 of mar be considered in the context of article 14 of mar
a7 8 the insider dealing prohibition contained in article 14 of mar applies during closed periods referred to in article 19 11 of mar in the same way as it does at any other time and must therefore be complied with by pdmrs
this means that when an issuer allows a pdmr to trade under article 19 12 of mar the general insider dealing provisions still apply and the pdmr must always give consideration as to whether or not the relevant transaction would constitute insider dealing
21 types of transactions by pdmrs prohibited during closed periods updated 21 november 2017 q7 9 are the types of transaction by a pdmr prohibited during a closed period under article 19 11 of mar the same as those types of transaction subject to the notification requirements set out under article 19 1 of mar
it is pointed out that article 19 11 of mar only applies to a pdmr when conducting transactions on its own account or for the account of a third party whereas the notification of transactions required under article 19 1 of mar also applies to persons closely associated to a pdmr
questions and answers on investment recommendation information recommending or suggesting an and investment strategy for the purpose of this section it is recalled that article 3 1 35 of mar sets out that investment recommendation means any information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy explicitly or implicitly concerning one or several financial instruments or the issuers including any opinion as to the present or future value or price of such instruments intended for distribution channels or for the public article 3 1 34 of mar sets out that information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy means information i produced by an independent analyst an investment firm a credit institution any other person whose main business is to produce investment recommendations or a natural person working for them under a contract of employment or otherwise which directly or indirectly expresses a particular investment proposal in respect of a financial instrument or an issuer or ii produced by persons other than those referred to in point i which directly proposes a particular investment decision in respect of a financial instrument communications made orally or via electronic means updated 26 october 2016 22 q8 1 do communications made orally or via electronic means such as telephone calls and chat functions or communications labelled e g morning notes or sales notes constitute an investment recommendation under mar
a8 1 any communication that meets the criteria of the definition of investment recommendation within the meaning of article 3 1 35 of mar in conjunction with article 3 1 34 of mar will be deemed to fall within the scope of the investment recommendation regime
when determining whether a communication is an investment recommendation an assessment should be made based on the substance of the communication irrespective of its name or label and the format form or the medium through which it is delivered whether electronically orally or otherwise
as such whether a specific oral or electronic communication or a communication labelled as morning notes or sales notes may be considered an investment recommendation within the meaning of mar it should be established on a case by case basis
where a standardised communication including oral or electronic communication is structured and pre planned for distribution channels and it implicitly or explicitly suggests an investment strategy in relation to a financial instrument or issuer it should be regarded as investment recommendation
communications not referring to one or several issuers updated 26 october 2016 q8 2 can communications that do not refer to either one or several financial instruments or issuers be considered investment recommendations under mar
a8 2 that meet the criteria of the definition of communications investment recommendation within the meaning of article 3 1 35 of mar in conjunction with article 3 1 34 of mar will be deemed to fall within the scope of the investment recommendation regime
in particular article 3 1 35 of mar sets out that investment recommendation means information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy explicitly or implicitly concerning one or several financial instruments or the issuers emphasis added including any opinion as to the present or future value or price of such instruments intended for distribution channels or for the public
therefore a communication that does not refer to either a financial instrument or an issuer should generally not be considered an investment recommendation
however the producer s assessment as to whether the above communication may be investment recommendation should be conducted on a case by case basis
communication relating solely to spot currency rates sectors interest rates loans commodities macroeconomic variables or industry sectors and not referring to a financial instrument or an issuer would be considered as investment recommendation where it contains information assessed as allowing a reasonable investor to deduce that the communication is implicitly recommending specific financial instruments or 23 issuers and provided that the other criteria of the definition of investment recommendation within the meaning of article 3 1 35 of mar in conjunction with article 3 1 34 of mar are met
for example an opinion on a specific sector that is composed of a very limited number of issuers may be considered an investment recommendation regarding those issuers
main businesss is not to produce investment recommendations updated 26 octobre 2016 q8 3 would an investment firm which produces an investment recommendation be considered to fall within the scope of article 3 1 34 i of mar even though the production of such recommendation is not its main business
a8 3 with regard to an investment firm any information that comprises direct or indirect investment proposals in respect of a financial instrument or an issuer will be considered as information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy as defined under point i of article 3 1 34 of mar
this is regardless of whether or not the production of investment recommendations is the main business of the investment firm noting that the condition whose main business is to produce investment recommendations contained in point i of article 3 1 34 of mar concerns any other person than independent analysts investment firms and credit institutions
information implicitly recommending or suggesting an investment strategy updated 26 october 2016 q8 4 does material intended for distribution channels or for the public concerning one or several financial instruments that contains statements indicating that the concerned financial instruments are undervalued fairly valued or overvalued fall within the definition of investment recommendation under mar
a8 4 such material which concerns one or several financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility or for which a request for admission to trading on such a market has been made or traded on a multilateral trading facility or an organised trading facility is considered as information implicitly recommending or suggesting an investment strategy pursuant to article 3 1 34 of mar insofar as it contains a valuation statement as to the price of the concerned financial instruments
furthermore material containing an estimated value such as a quantitative fair value estimate that is providing a projected price level or price target or any other elements of opinion on the value of the financial instruments is also considered to be information implicitly recommending or suggesting an investment strategy pursuant to article 3 1 34 of mar
as the material referred to above is an investment recommendation under mar it needs to comply with the relevant obligations and standards set out in mar and 24 commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 of the european parliament and of the council concerning the objective presentation of investment recommendations or other information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy and the disclosure of particular interests and conflicts of interest by producers of such recommendations
in addition a third party that disseminates such material is considered as a disseminator of investment recommendations and therefore needs to comply with the relevant obligations and standards set out in mar and commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 of the european parliament and of the council
communications containing purely factual information updated 20 december 2016 q8 5 do communications to clients containing purely factual information on one or investment issuers constitute an instrument or several recommendation under mar
financial a8 5 in consideration of the definition of an investment recommendation within the meaning of article 3 1 35 of mar in conjunction with article 3 1 34 of mar any communication containing purely factual information on one or several financial instruments or issuers would not constitute an investment recommendation under mar provided that it does not explicitly or implicitly recommend or suggest an investment strategy
in this context factual information might among other things include recent events or news relating to one or several financial instruments or issuers
communications on previously disseminated investment recommendations updated 20 december 2016 q8 6 do communications intended for distribution channels or for the public which only report or refer to previously disseminated investment recommendation and do not include any new elements of opinion or valuation or confirmation of a previous opinion or valuation constitute an investment recommendation under mar
a8 6 no such a communication will not amount to a new investment recommendation but would still be subject to article 7 of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 if it is disseminated by the producer of the investment recommendation and therefore such a communication shall include the date and time of first issuance of the investment recommendation
if a communication reports or refers to a former investment recommendation but contains either confirmation of the previous opinion or valuation or new elements of opinion or valuation which may be based on new facts or events concerning the issuer which are considered in the valuation it will be viewed as a new investment recommendation and all aspects of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 would need to be considered
25 in case a person disseminates recommendations produced by third parties articles 8 to 10 of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 need to be considered
recommendation on derivatives traded solely outside a trading venue updated 20 december 2016 q8 7 are recommendations relating to derivatives traded solely outside a trading venue in scope of article 20 of mar
a8 7 in line with articles 2 1 d and 2 3 of mar a derivative traded outside a trading venue is in scope of mar insofar as its price or value depends on or has an effect on the price or value of a financial instrument referred to in article 2 1 a b or c of mar
if the price or value of a derivative traded outside a trading venue does not depend on or have an effect on the price or value of a financial instrument referred to in article 2 1 a b or c of mar the derivative would not be in scope of mar and therefore any recommendation relating to the financial instrument would not be in scope of article 20 of mar
therefore firms are responsible for conducting their own assessment on a case by case basis as to whether a recommendation on a given derivative traded solely outside a trading venue is in scope of article 20 of mar and subject to the requirements of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958
identification of derivatives in investment recommendations updated 20 december 2016 q8 8 where a recommendation relates to a derivative how should it be determined whether a recommendation has been given on the same financial instrument for the purposes of complying with article 4 1 h of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958
a8 8 where a unique identifier exists for the concerned derivative such identifier has to be used to determine whether there has been a change in a previous recommendation given by the producer on the same financial instrument
for as long as a unique identifier does not exist for a derivative instrument all reasonable efforts should be made to identify such a financial instrument by other means so as to comply with article 4 1 h of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958
in determining recommendations on the same financial instrument for the purposes of article 4 1 h of commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 common features of a given derivative contract including but not limited to strike underlying or maturity could be identified
such an approach should allow producers 26 of recommendations to provide meaningful disclosures to recipients and still comply with the requirements
recommendations on multiple issuers updated 27 january 2017 q8 9 how does commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 apply when the subject of the recommendation relates to multiple issuers independently
a8 9 when a recommendation refers to several issuers independently for example as part of sectorial research the requirements would apply independently to every issuer that is the subject of the recommendation
recommendations relating to several financial instruments independently updated 27 january 2017 q8 10 how does commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 apply when the subject of the recommendation relates to several financial instruments independently
a8 10 where a recommendation refers to several financial instruments independently such as part of sectorial research the requirements would apply to each financial instrument that is the subject of the recommendation
recommendations on a derivative referencing an index updated 27 january 2017 q8 11 how does commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 apply when the subject of the recommendation is a derivative referencing an index
a8 11 if a recommendation relates to a derivative referencing an index of financial instruments the derivative itself should be treated as a financial instrument subject to the requirements of the commission delegated regulation eu 2016 958 and not the individual instruments that comprise the index
questions and answers on market soundings financial instruments in scope of the market sounding regime updated 1 september 2017 27 q9 1 does the scope of article 11 of mar cover all communications of information to one or more potential investors prior to the announcement of a transaction in order to gauge their interest in a possible transaction and the conditions relating to it
a9 1 under the market sounding regime outlined in article 11 of mar the communication of information by an issuer a secondary offeror an emission allowances market participant or third party acting on their behalf or account the disclosing market participant dmp should be deemed to be made in the normal course of the employment duties or profession of such a person where all the conditions contained in article 11 of mar are met and therefore not constitute unlawful disclosure of inside information
article 11 1 of mar concerns market soundings that gauge the interest of potential investors in a possible transaction in a financial instrument and the conditions relating to it such as its potential size or pricing
those financial instruments have to be financial instruments covered by the mar scope as specified in article 2 1 of mar a financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market or for which a request for admission to trading on a regulated market has been made b financial instruments traded on an mtf admitted to trading on an mtf or for which a request for admission to trading on an mtf has been made c financial instruments traded on an otf d financial instruments not covered by point a b or c the price or value of which depends on or has an effect on the price or value of a financial instrument referred to in those points including but not limited to credit default swaps and contracts for difference
where the financial instrument subject to the possible transaction is already admitted to trading or a request for admission to trading has been made or is traded on a trading venue as for example when the new transaction relates to an increase of an existing issuance then that transaction will fall within scope of article 11
where the financial instrument subject to the possible transaction is not admitted to trading nor a request for admission to trading has been made nor traded on a trading venue that financial instrument would not fall under article 2 1 a c of mar
that financial instrument would fall under article 2 1 d of mar if its price or value depends on or has an effect on the price or value of another existing financial instrument in scope of mar
in such a case to determine if article 2 1 d applies the dmp must assess on a case by case basis whether there is any relationship between the price or value of the financial instrument that is the subject of the sounding and any other existing financial instrument falling under article 2 1 a c of mar such as for instance other financial instruments of the issuer in question or of a parent company
28 where the dmp assessed that such relationship exists then the financial instrument will be in scope of mar and the related possible transaction will be in scope of the mar market sounding regime
if there is uncertainty as to whether there is a price or value relationship such as where there are no data available regarding a new financial instrument in order to receive the protection under article 11 should it be subsequently shown that there was a relationship an appropriate approach would be for the dmp to apply the provisions of article 11 of mar and the relevant delegated and implementing regulations
questions and answers on insider lists subject of the insider list requirements updated 1 september 2017 q10 1 are persons acting on behalf or account of the issuer e g advisors and consultants subject to the obligation to draw up update and provide to the nca upon request their own insider list under article 18 1 of mar
a10 1 yes the legislative aim of the insider list regime under mar is to cover any person that by virtue of its action on behalf or account of the issuer has access to inside information
therefore not only the issuer but also all the persons acting on behalf or account of the issuer that have access to inside information relating to the issuer e g advisors and consultants are subject to the obligation to draw up update and provide to the nca upon request their respective insider list under article 18 of mar
issuer s responsibility in case of delegation updated 1 september 2017 q10 2 when does the issuer remain fully responsible under the second subparagraph of article 18 2 of mar for the compliance with the insider list requirements by persons acting on behalf or account of the issuer
a10 2 the issuer remains fully responsible under the second subparagraph of article 18 2 of mar only where a service provider assumes the task of drawing up and updating the insider list of the issuer on the basis of a specific delegation to that purpose
the issuer is not responsible for the fulfilment of the insider list requirements of the persons acting on its behalf or account mentioned in article 18 1 of mar and first subparagraph of article 18 2 e g advisors and consultants who are personally 29 responsible for the obligation to draw up update and provide to the nca upon request their own insider list
where the person that assumes the task of drawing up and updating the insider list of the issuer under the second subparagraph of article 18 2 of mar is also a person acting on behalf or account of the issuer under article 18 1 of mar e g advisors and consultants that person will be responsible for the obligation to draw up update and provide to the nca upon request its own insider list
the issuer will remain responsible for complying with the insider list requirements in relation to its own insider list the drawing up and updating of which has been delegated to the same person as part of a separate agreement
questions and answers on emission allowances and emission allowances market participants eamps time span for the calculation of the co2 equivalent emissions and the rated thermal input updated 14 december 2017 q11 1 what period should be used to calculate whether one of the thresholds set out in article 17 2 of mar has been exceeded
a11 1 a participant in the emission allowance market should use a calendar year period one year period that begins on january 1 and ends on december 31 for the annual calculation of the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and the rated thermal input rti of 31 december of the same year
the calculated emissions over a given year y or the rti as of 31 december of a given year y should be assessed against the minimum thresholds of 6 million tonnes a year of equivalent carbon dioxide or the minimum rti threshold of 2 430 mw specified in article 5 1 a and b of the commission delegated regulation eu 2016 522
where either of these thresholds is exceeded the market participant will be deemed to be an emission allowance market participant eamp as defined in article 3 20 of mar as of 1 may of the following year y 1 and thus subject to the obligations applicable to eamps under mar including the requirement to disclose inside information concerning emission allowances it or its parent undertaking or related undertakings may hold
this approach for mar purpose will be aligned with the compliance cycle of the eu emissions trading system stemming from directive 2003 87 ec
in practice this means that the year of reference for the calculations should be 2016 to determine whether a participant is an eamp between 3 january and 30 april 2018 and 2017 to determine whether a participant is an eamp from 1 may 2018 onwards until the next calculations become applicable on 1 may 2019
30 it is reminded that the calculations should take into account all business including aviation activities or installations which a participant in the emission allowance market or its parent undertaking or related undertaking owns or controls or for the operational matters of which that participant or its parent undertaking or related undertaking is responsible in whole or in part
