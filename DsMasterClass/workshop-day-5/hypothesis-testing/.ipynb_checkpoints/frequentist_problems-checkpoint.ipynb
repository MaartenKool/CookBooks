    "The same data could be recorded in each of these cases. The problem is however that the underlying sampling distributions are very different. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example the number of successes in $n$ binary outcomes would be described by the binomial distribution. If instead one were asking for the probability of having to complete a certain number of trials before having $k$ successes, one needs the negative binomial distribution.\n",

    "Prevent dependence of such a stopping rule could be addressed by fixing the number of desired trials before an experiment which then however makes it impossible to react to experimental findings."
