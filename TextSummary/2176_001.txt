1  Introduction 
 
Background 
The final legislative texts of Directive 2014/65/EU1 (MiFID II) and Regulation (EU) No 600/20142 
(MiFIR) were approved by the European Parliament on 15 April 2014 and by the European 
Council on 13 May 2014. The two texts were published in the Official Journal on 12 June 2014 
and entered into force on the twentieth day following this publication – i.e. 2 July 2014. 
Many of the obligations under MiFID II and MiFIR were further specified in the Commission 
Delegated Directive3 and two Commission Delegated Regulations4 5, as well as regulatory and 
implementing  technical  standards  developed  by  the  European  Securities  and  Markets 
Authority (ESMA).  
MiFID II and MiFIR, together with the Commission delegated acts as well as regulatory and 
implementing technical standards will be applicable from 3 January 2018.  
Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in 
the  application  of  MiFID  II/  MiFIR  in  relation  to  the  position  limits,  position  reporting  and 
ancillary activity provisions and other aspects of the commodity derivatives regime in MiFID II. 
It  provides  responses  to  questions  posed  by  the  general  public,  market  participants  and 
competent authorities in relation to the practical application of MiFID II/MiFIR.  
The content of this document is aimed at competent authorities and firms by providing clarity 
on the application of the MiFID II and MiFIR requirements.  
The content of this document is not exhaustive and it does not constitute new policy. 
 
                                                
1 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and 
amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU. 
2 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments 
and amending Regulation (EU) N0 648/2012. 
3 Commission  Delegated  Directive  (EU)  2017/593  of  of  7  April  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  safeguarding  of  financial  instruments  and  funds  belonging  to  clients,  product

Status  
The Q&A mechanism is a practical convergence tool used to promote common supervisory 
approaches and practices under Article 29(2) of the ESMA Regulation.6  
Due  to  the  nature  of  Q&As,  formal  consultation  on  the  draft  answers  is  considered 
unnecessary. However, even if they are not formally consulted on, ESMA may discuss them 
with  representatives  of  ESMA’s  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group,  the  relevant 
Standing Committees’ Consultative Working Group or, where specific expertise is needed, with 
other external parties.  
ESMA will periodically review these questions and answers to identify if, in a certain area, there 
is a need to convert some of the material into ESMA Guidelines and recommendations. In such 
cases, the procedures foreseen under Article 16 of the ESMA Regulation would be followed.  
The  Q&As  in  this  document  cover  only  activities  of  EU  investment  firms  in  the  EU,  unless 
specifically mentioned otherwise. Third country related issues, and in particular the treatment 
of  non-EU  branches  of EU  investment firms,  will  be  addressed  in  a  dedicated  third  country 
section.

2  Position limits [Last update: 02/10/2018] 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Are position limits applicable only at the end of each trading day or also throughout the trading 
day? 
Answer 1 
Position  limits  are  applicable  at  all  times.  This  is  particularly  relevant  when  a  commodity 
derivative is traded OTC outside the normal trading hours of a trading venue.  
 
Question 2 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
What is the definition of a lot for the application of  Article 15(1)(a) and (b) (New and illiquid 
contracts) of RTS 21 to those commodity derivatives for which a lot, as defined in the contract 
specification by the trading venue, does not represent a standard quantity of the underlying 
across all maturities/delivery periods for that commodity derivative?   
Answer 2 
In some derivative markets (mainly related to power or gas), trading venues offer trading in 
derivative contracts that refer to an identical underlying but have a variety of delivery periods, 
e.g.  annual  (calendar),  quarterly,  monthly,  weekly  (whole  week,  working  day  week  and 
weekend) or daily. 
For these contracts a lot or unit of trading, as defined in the contract specification by the trading 
venue,  does  not  necessarily  represent  a  standard  quantity  of  underlying  across  all 
maturities/delivery periods, i.e. the lot size for a daily contract is different from that for a monthly 
contract as the lot size usually depends on the number of relevant days and/or hours in the 
delivery period. For baseload power derivatives, this is illustrated by the following table: 
Delivery period 
Unit of trading 
(1 Lot = 1MW) 
Quantity  of  underlying 
commodity (baseload) 
Lot size 
1 day 
1 week – 7 days 
1 month – 30 days 
1 MW 
1 MW 
1 MW 
24 MWh 
168 MWh 
720 MWh 
24 h 
168 h 
720 h 
Since  there  is  not  an  unambiguous  equivalence  between  a  lot  and  an  absolute  quantity  of 
underlying commodity, it is necessary to define a reference period and use the associated lot 
size to determine the liquidity of a contract under Article 15(1)(a) and (b) of RTS 21 and to set 
position limits under Article 15(1)(a) of RTS 21.  
15 
 
 
 
 
As the trading activity in European power and gas derivative markets is generally concentrated 
in monthly contracts, the period of the monthly contract should be used as the reference period. 
The  associated  lot  size  should  be  calculated  by  using  the  relevant  days  and/or  hours  as 
specified by the trading venue for that particular contract type. 
Example:  
Lot size calculation for a monthly base load and a monthly peak load power derivative contract 
to determine liquidity and set position limits for illiquid contracts: 
Base load lot size = 30 days * 24 hours/day = 720 h, 10,000 lots are equivalent to 7.2 TWh, 
Peak load lot size: 22 days * 12 hours/day = 264 h, 10,000 lots are equivalent to 2.64 TWh. 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
What is a lot in the case of Economically Equivalent OTC contracts (EEOTC)? 
Answer 3  
A significant number of OTC contracts are specified by reference to a quantity of the underlying 
commodity  and  not  the  standardised  lot  sizes  of  an  exchange-traded  derivative.  Where  an 
OTC contract is not defined in standardised lots the size of the contract should be calculated 
as  a  multiple  of  the  standard  unit  of  trading  used  by  the  trading  venue  for  the  commodity 
derivative to which the OTC contract is equivalent.  
 
Question 4 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Should positions with different maturities for other months’ limits be netted? 
Answer 4 
Yes.  Persons must  determine their  net  position for  each  commodity  derivative  for  the  other 
months’ limit, as indicated in Article 3(4) of RTS 21.  
They should sum (or net, as appropriate) all individual positions across the curve excluding 
those positions in the spot month for that commodity derivative.  
 
Question 5 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
How should non-EU entities with positions above the limits be treated? Do they have access 
to exemptions, and if so, when and how do they apply to the relevant NCA? 
16 
 
 
 
 
Answer 5 
A non-financial entity from outside the EU (European Union) may apply for an exemption in 
the same manner as an EU firm would. The rules and procedures are laid down in RTS 21. 
 
Question 6 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
How do limits apply to long and short positions? 
Answer 6 
Position limits apply to net positions regardless of whether the net position is long or short. 
When calculating their positions, a person needs to aggregate their long and short holdings in 
spot contracts towards the spot month limit. They separately need to aggregate all their long 
and short positions for all other months towards the other months’ limit.  
 
Question 7 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Are securitised derivatives considered to be commodity derivatives under MiFID II? How does 
ESMA differentiate between ETCs and securitised derivatives? 
Answer 7 
“Securitised  derivatives”  are  transferable  securities  whose  value  is  based  upon  underlying 
assets. However, neither MiFID I (incl. level 2 thereof), nor MiFID II/MiFIR contain a specific 
definition of these instruments.  
Where  the  underlying  asset  of  securitised  derivatives  is  one  or  more  commodities,  these 
instruments  are  caught  by  the  definition  of  “transferable  securities”  in  Article  4(1)(44)(c)  of 
MIFID II and are commodity derivatives under Article 2(1)(30) of MiFIR. 
Exchange  traded  commodities  (ETCs)  are  debt  instruments  which  are  within  the  scope  of 
Article 4(1)(44)(b) of MiFID II and are classified as such in RTS 2. Therefore, they are outside 
the definition of commodity derivatives in Article 2(1)(30) of MiFIR and the position limits regime 
does not apply to them.  
ESMA  is  aware  that  market  practices  in  differentiating  between  ETCs  and  securitised 
derivatives  are  neither  clear  nor  uniform  and  presents the following  guidance  to  allow  for  a 
correct classification of instruments in practice.  
In RTS 2 ETCs are described as debt instruments issued against a direct investment by the 
issuer  in  commodities  or  commodity  derivative  contracts. The  price  of an  ETC  is  directly  or 
indirectly linked to the performance of the underlying. An ETC passively tracks the performance 
of the commodity or the commodity indices to which it refers.  
17 
 
 
 
 
In addition, ESMA considers that ETCs typically have the following features: 
  a primary market exists which is accessible only to authorised market participants per-
mitting the creation and redemption of securities on a daily basis at the price set by the 
issuer; 
 
they are not UCITS and therefore unlike an ETF can have an exposure profile not in 
compliance with the UCITS diversification requirements;  
 
they are traded on- and off-venue in significant volumes;  
 
the  price  is  aligned,  or  multiplied  by  a  fixed  leverage  of  the  price  of  the  underlying 
commodity;  
  a management fee is charged by the issuer;  
 
they may be issued by non-banking institutions; 
 
they do not have an expiry date; 
 
they may have a strict regime of capital segregation, usually through the use of special 
purpose vehicles; 
 
they are often aimed at professional investors. 
In  comparison,  the  term  ‘securitised  derivatives’  describes  a  much  wider  set  of  financial 
instruments that can have a large variety of features among them the following typical features: 
 
 
they can have commodities as underlying but also many financial instruments or they 
can be linked to strategies, indices or baskets of instruments; 
they can passively track the performance of the underlying but they can typically also 
apply leverage, can have an option structure or also have a lower risk profile than the 
underlying by, for example, offering capital protection; 
 
they are traded on venue or OTC by the issuer directly or via intermediaries;  
 
the issuers’ costs and compensation are factored into their price;  
 
they have an expiration date; 
 
they provide an issuer credit risk exposure; 
 
they are often aimed at retail clients.

Question 8 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Are  the  net  positions  held  by  clearing  members usable  for  the  purposes of  determining  the 
positions of their clients for the application of position limits under Article 57? 
Answer 8 
No. Central counterparties determine net positions at the level of their clearing members, which 
usually  encompass  the  long  and  short  position  of  many  different  clients  unless  held  in 
individually segregated accounts. A CCP may also see positions only for those contracts for 
which it provides a central counterparty service and not the EEOTC positions or any held at a 
CCP subject to interoperability. Position limits apply at the level of the individual person, and 
net positions held at clearing level must therefore be disaggregated. 
 
Question 9 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
Will  there  be  a  different  position  limit  for  options  and  futures?  If  so,  how  should  options  be 
converted into futures for the application of position limits? 
Answer 9 
No, there will be no separate limits for futures and options on the same commodity derivative. 
Futures and options are fungible in terms of their economic effect at expiry if an option expires 
in the money with the respective future expiring at the same time. During the life of an option 
contract, the probability of the option expiring in the money is reflected in its delta value. 
Option  positions  should  therefore  be  converted  into  positions  in  their  respective  future 
contracts on the basis of the current delta to arrive at a delta equivalent futures position. Long 
delta equivalent positions on calls and short delta equivalent positions on puts should be added 
to  positions  on  futures.  Short  delta  equivalent  positions  on  calls  and  long  delta  equivalent 
positions on puts should be subtracted from positions on futures. 
If available, position holders should use the delta value published by the trading venue or the 
CCP to report their positions in options. In the absence of a published delta value, position 
holders  may  use  their  own  calculation.  Position  holders  should  be  able  to  demonstrate,  on 
demand, to the NCA responsible for the application of the position limit that their calculations 
correctly reflect the value of the option.  
To  determine  which  contracts  are  liquid  under  Article15  of  RTS  21  and  also  to  establish 
position limits based on the quantity of open interest, the open interest of futures plus the delta-
adjusted open interest of options should be used, where there is a future and/or option traded 
on the commodity derivative and the relevant data  are available.  This is consistent with the 
reporting of positions made under Article 58 of RTS 21.

Question 10 [Last update: 27/03/2018] 
How is the position limits regime applied to the various underlyings listed in Annex I, Section 
C(10) of MIFID II? 
Answer 10 
Section  C(10)  of  Annex  I  of  MIFID  II  covers  a  number  of  different  types  of  commodity 
derivatives. For these instruments the following approaches should be taken: 
Position limits should be applied to freight rate derivatives (wet and dry freight) based on the 
open interest both in the spot month and in the other months.  
Position  limits  should  be  applied  to  derivative  contracts relating to  indices  if the  underlying 
index is materially based on commodity underlyings as defined in Article 2 No. 6 of Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565  of 25 April 2016. ESMA considers that  the underlying 
index is materially based on commodities if such commodities have a weighting of more than 
50% in the composition of the underlying index. The spot and the other months’ limits should 
be  based  on  open  interest  only,  in  accordance  with  Article  13(1)  of  RTS  21,  as  no  single 
measurable  deliverable  supply  can  be  determined for  the  commodities contained  within  the 
index.  
A commodity derivative contract in the legal form of a “spread” or “diff” contract is a contract 
that is cash-settled and whose value is determined by the difference between two reference 
commodities which may vary in type, grade, location, time of delivery, or other features. The 
application of the regime regarding these contracts is dealt with specifically in question 17.  
For other derivatives listed in Section C10 of Annex I of MiFID II and in Article 8 of Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016, ESMA is not expecting the setting of 
any position limits as the underlyings of such derivatives are not considered to be commodities 
as defined in Article 2 No. 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 
2016.  
 
Question 11 [Last update: 29/03/2017] 
Can a hedge exemption be netted against positions in derivatives which are not objectively 
measurable as reducing risks directly related to that person’s commercial activity? 
Answer 11 
No.  Once  an  exemption  has  been  granted  and  positions  are  approved  as  risk-reducing  in 
accordance  with  Article  8  of  RTS  21,  those  positions  fall  outside  the  position  limit  regime. 
Otherwise,  the  benefit  of  a  risk-reducing  position  would  be  double-counted,  by  first  being 
excluded from the limit and then being used to offset a speculative exposure.

Question 12 [Last update: 29/03/2017] 
What is the meaning of the ‘single fungible pool of open interest’ in Art 5.1(b) of RTS 21? Does 
it refer only to those commodity derivatives cleared in the same central counterparty? 
Answer 12 
Commodity derivatives with a single fungible pool of open interest would include those cleared 
by the same central counterparty (CCP) and those in interoperable CCPs which may be closed 
out  against  each  other.  It  would  also  include  other  commodity  derivatives  with  delivery 
obligations which are fungible and can be closed out against each other (for example, through 
the operational netting provided by a transmission system operator). 
 
Question 13 [Last update: 29/03/2017] 
How should contracts that have a high variability of open interest during the year be treated 
(i.e. minimum open interest is below 10,000 lots but maximum above it)? 
Answer 13 
Article 15 of RTS 21 states that new and illiquid contracts for which the total combined open 
interest  in  spot  and  other  months’  contracts  does  not  exceed  10,000  lots  for  a  consecutive 
three-month period are assigned a position limit of 2,500 lots. Therefore, any contract with a 
high variability would have to exceed the threshold of 10,000 lots of open interest on a daily 
basis  based  on  end-of-day  figures  for  three  consecutive  months  before  an  individualised 
position limit has to be set for that contract. 
 
Question 14 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Is it necessary for a Non-Financial Entity (NFE) to apply to the relevant NCA of a trading venue 
for a position limit exemption in all contracts in which that NFE holds positions? 
Answer 14 
No.  It  is  necessary  only  for  an  NFE  to  apply  for  an  exemption  when  it  expects  that  one  is 
necessary to permit it to hold a position that is risk-reducing for its commercial activities which 
would be in excess of the position limit for that commodity derivative which has been set by 
the NCA.   
There is no requirement under MIFID II to apply for a position limit exemption if an NFE does 
not expect to need one for its normal level of activities.

Question 15 [Last update: 15/12/2017] 
How should the spot month be defined for contracts where there are daily, weekly, quarterly 
and calendar as well as monthly variants of the same contract? 
Answer 15 
The determination of the spot month for the application of the spot month position limit should 
be made by the NCA on the basis of the contract specification and the characteristics of the 
market for that particular commodity derivative.  
Where there are daily or weekly as well as monthly contracts, the positions to be included in 
the  spot  month  period  and  subject  to  the  position  limit,  include  positions  in  contracts 
referencing days or weeks which fall entirely inside that spot month. 
For  many  contracts,  the  spot  month  will  be  the  current  calendar  month  in  which  delivery  is 
taking  place  (until  the  final  day  of  that  month).  For  example,  between  1  and  30  January, 
January is the spot month.  
In other contracts, where e.g. the January contract expires at the end of December, the spot 
month will change to the next calendar month which is available to trade. For these contracts, 
for most of January, the spot month will be February (and positions in any days or weeks falling 
wholly within February will count towards the spot month limit).  
 
Question 16 [Last update: 27/03/2018] 
How can limits be set for contracts with an open interest between 5,000 and 10,000 lots which 
have a low number of market participants or market makers as described  in Article 19(2) of 
RTS 21?  
Answer 16 
Article 15(1)(a) and (c) of RTS 21 establishes a fixed limit of respectively 2,500 lots for lower 
liquidity commodity derivative contracts and 2.5 million securities for lower liquidity securitised 
derivatives whereas Article 19(2) of RTS 21 allows limits of up to 50% if the contract has less 
than ten market participants or less than three investment firms acting as market makers.  
RTS 21 does not establish a hierarchy between these two Articles. Accordingly, to achieve the 
aims set out in Article 57(1) of MiFID II, where commodity derivatives traded on a trading venue 
have a total combined open interest in spot and other months’ contracts exceeding 5,000 lots, 
authorities may set the limits of positions held in those commodity derivatives using either the 
default 2,500 lot limit under Article 15(1)(a) of RTS 21 or a limit within the range established 
by Article 19(2) of RTS 21. The limit under Article 19(2) of RTS 21 would be used where the 
automatic limit under Article 15(1)(a) would unduly constrain the operation of the market and 
prevent the contract from supporting the functioning of commercial activities in the underlying 
22 
 
 
 
 
market, as clarified in Recital (1) of RTS 21. The limit would be established in accordance with 
the baseline and the relevant adjustment factors set out in Article 14 of RTS 21. 
For  securitised  derivatives  with  an  issuance  size  between  five  and  ten  million  securities,  
a similar approach applies. Where necessary to allow for the proper operation of the market, 
competent authorities may set a position limit within the range established in Article 19(2) of 
RTS 21 when the conditions thereof are met. The position limit would apply to the number of 
securities in issuance and would be the same for the spot month and the other months.  
 
Question 17 [Last update: 27/03/2018] 
How are position limits applied to intercommodity ‘spread’ or ‘diff’ contracts? 
Answer 17 
A  commodity  derivative  contract  in  the  legal  form  of  a  “spread”  or  “diff”  contract  is  a  cash-
settled  contract  whose  value  is  determined  by  the  difference  between  two  reference 
commodities that may vary in, inter alia, type, grade, location, or delivery characteristics. Whilst 
having multiple underlying constituents, the spread derivative is available on a trading venue 
as a single tradable financial instrument.  
A spread contract differs from a ‘spread trading strategy’ (two or more commodity contracts 
traded together to achieve a particular economic effect), as such a strategy may be executed 
by  a  single  action  in  a  venue’s  trading  systems,  but  it  remains  composed  of  separate,  and 
legally distinct commodity derivatives which are executed as trades simultaneously. 
As a spread contract has no single underlying commodity at a specific place or time, it is not 
possible  to  link  it  to  a  single  physical  deliverable  supply  against  a  contractual  obligation  to 
physically settle the trade.  It is for this reason all spread contracts are cash-settled and not 
physically settled.  
Article  57(4)  of  MiFID  II  states  ‘A  competent  authority  shall  set  limits  for  each  contract  in 
commodity  derivatives  traded  on  trading  venues  based  on  the  methodology  […]’.  Whilst 
specifically  referencing  each  contract,  this  should  refer  to  outright  instruments  (i.e.  the 
disaggregated components of spreads) and the limits be applied at that level. The prevailing 
limits will apply to the net eligible positions, inclusive of spread limits, post-disaggregation.  
In  cases  where  a constituent  leg  is  not  independently  admitted for trading,  then the  spread 
itself will receive a limit (de minimis or bespoke). In these cases, the same methodology as for 
C10  commodity  derivatives  that  have  no  physical  underlying  will  apply,  as  such  the  open 
interest figure for the spread shall be used as the baseline for both the Spot Month and Other 
Months’ limits. 
 
 
23 
 
 
 
 
Question 18 [Last update: 02/10/2018] *New* 
Do  position  limits  also  apply  to  positions  in  contracts  that  have  been  entered  into  prior to  3 
January  2018  and  are  traded  on  a  trading  venue,  including  an  OTF,  or  are  economically 
equivalent OTC contracts (EEOTC) to those traded on a trading venue? 
Answer 18 
Yes. The position limits regime does apply to all positions in commodity derivatives offered by 
EU  trading  venues  and EEOTC  contracts,  irrespective  of the time  when  the  contracts  have 
been entered into. This is even the case if the relevant financial instrument was not a financial 
instrument at the time of the contract formation, e.g. prior to the application of MiFID II on 3 
January 2018. 
 
This is because all positions in a MiFID II commodity derivative held by a position holder are 
assessed constantly and from the point of application (see also Q&A 1). Articles 57 and 58 of 
MiFID II do not refer to the formation of the contract in any of their provisions. As soon as a 
financial instrument becomes subject to the position limits regime, the position limits apply to 
the positions of position holders and are to be reported and monitored against position limits. 
 
3  Ancillary activity [Last update: 02/10/2018] 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Do  all  legal  entities  that  deal  in  commodity  derivatives  within  a  financial  group  need  to  be 
individually authorised as investment firms? 
Answer 1 
Yes. Under Article 2(1)(j), the exemption for trading in commodity derivatives only applies when 
the main business of the group is considered on an overall basis not to be the provision of in-
vestment  services  within  the  meaning  of  this  Directive  or  banking  activities  under  Directive 
2013/36/EU. 
Therefore, all entities within a group which cannot be considered as a non-financial group are 
required  to  obtain  authorisation  as  an  investment  firm  under  MiFID  II  if  they  wish  to  trade 
commodity derivatives.  
 
Question 2 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Does trading activity in C6 contracts which takes place on OTFs after 3 January 2018 need to 
be counted towards the ancillary thresholds prior to that date? 
 
24 
 
 
 
 
Answer 2 
We  differentiate  between  wholesale  energy  products  categorised  as  C6  within  the  REMIT 
scope (derivatives with electricity and natural gas as underlying traded on an OTF that must 
be  physically  settled),  C6  energy  derivatives  contracts  (those  with  coal  or  oil  as  underlying 
traded on an OTF that must be physically settled) and the rest of C6 instruments.  
Financial instruments under MiFID I which will also be financial instruments within C6 under 
MiFID  II  should  count  towards  the  trading  activity  and  assessed  against  the  ancillary 
thresholds. 
C6 with coal or oil as underlying and the rest of C6 instruments count throughout the calculation 
period to determine market size, as OTC instruments until January 3, 2018 and as OTF on-
venue instruments after that. For C6 instruments with coal or oil as underlying traded on OTFs 
this assessment is based on them only being exempted from certain EMIR obligations for a 
transitional  period  while  they  are  being  classified  as  financial  instruments  throughout  the 
period. The same applies to the computation of positions by non-financial corporates. 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 02/10/2018] *modified* 
Since elements of the ancillary activity tests are to be calculated on a group level, is only Can 
the  parent  undertaking  obliged  to  notify  its  NCA  for  the  whole  group  or  do  the  subsidiary 
undertakings also have to notify their local NCA?  
Answer 3 
The ancillary exemption applies to persons. Notification to the relevant NCA for that person is 
a  condition  for  using  the  exemption.  Therefore,  any  person  that  is  party  to  a  commodity 
derivative will need to notify its relevant NCA. This also applies to persons who are part of a 
group. It is not possible for a group to apply for an exemption on behalf of all the entities that 
the group contains. 
 
Question 4 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
Who has to notify annually the relevant competent authority that they make use of the ancillary 
activity exemption?  
Answer 4 
In  general,  any  (natural  or  legal)  person  that  deals  on  own  account  or  provides  investment 
services in commodity derivatives as a regular occupation or business on a professional basis 
pursuant to Article 5 of MiFID II has to be authorised as an investment firm under MiFID II. 
However, if the person meets the criteria for activities considered to be ancillary to the main 
business pursuant to Article 2(1)(j) and the provisions in RTS 20 and makes use of the ancillary 
25 
 
 
 
 
activity  exemption,  then  it  has  to  notify  annually  the  relevant  competent  authority  that  they 
make use of this exemption. 
 
Question 5 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
To  which  competent  authority  should  a  person  provide  notification  that  it  makes  use  of  the 
ancillary activity exemption? 
Answer 5 
The relevant competent authority will be the national competent authority to which the person 
would  need  to  apply  for  authorisation  if  it  were  unable  to  make  use  of  the  ancillary  activity 
exemption. 
 
Question 6 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
By when does a firm that wants to make use of the ancillary activity exemption need to notify 
its competent authority? 
Answer 6 
Article 2(1)(j) of MiFID II exempts persons who deal in commodity derivatives on an ancillary 
basis under a number of conditions. One of these conditions is that they notify annually the 
relevant competent authority that they make use of this exemption. The notification needs to 
have been made for a firm to be able to rely on it. 
The first of such notifications must be made by January 3rd of 2018. For 2019 and subsequent 
years, the notification needs to be made by April 1st of each year. Any firm that has not applied 
for authorisation has to notify. 
 
Question 7 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
When does a firm that can no longer make use of the ancillary activity exemption need to apply 
for a license? 
Answer 7 
When a person’s trading activity increases to such an extent that it can no longer be considered 
to be ancillary to its main business under Article 2(1)(j), the firm must apply to the competent 
authority for a license.  
26 
 
 
 
 
Firms may not be certain whether they will be able to benefit from the exemption until the data 
on market size becomes available. Those who have reasonable grounds for considering they 
will be able to benefit from the ancillary activity exemption should notify. Where subsequently 
the  market  data  indicates  that  this  is  not  the  case,  the  firm  would  be  expected  to  apply  for 
authorisation as soon as reasonably practicable. 
 
Question 8 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
What are the criteria that liquidity provision contracts need to meet in order to qualify for the 
privileged transactions exemption under Article 2(4) of MiFID II? 
Answer 8 
Article 2(4) fifth paragraph, letter (c) of MiFID II permits a number of transaction types to be 
classified as “privileged transactions” and thus to be set aside for the purposes of the ancillary 
activity calculations.  Those transaction types include “transactions in commodity derivatives 
and emission allowances entered into to fulfil obligations to provide liquidity on a trading venue, 
where such obligations are required by regulatory authorities in accordance with Union law or 
with national laws, regulations and administrative provisions, or by trading venues”. Therefore, 
Article 2(4)(c) of MiFID II establishes two alternatives of liquidity provision programmes that 
can be exempt from the ancillary activity calculations, one being based on requirements by 
regulatory authorities and the other based on requirements imposed by trading venues. Under 
both alternatives it is only the transactions carried out under the liquidity programme that are 
exempt but not the liquidity provider as a person.  
When elaborating the Level 2 rules, ESMA offered one example of the circumstances in which 
transactions undertaken in order to fulfil liquidity obligations would be privileged, i.e. the market 
making  requirements  established  by  the  UK  energy  regulator,  OFGEM,  which  oblige  large 
electricity suppliers to post the prices at which they buy and sell wholesale electricity on power 
trading platforms up to two years in advance and to trade at those prices. This is an example 
of an obligation required by a regulatory authority in line with applicable national rules which 
satisfies the conditions imposed by the first alternative described in Article 2(4)(c) of MiFID II.  
Article  2(4)(c)  of  MiFID  II  uses  the  term  “obligations  to  provide  liquidity”  as  opposed  to  the 
related term market maker which is used in Article 2(1)(j)(i) of MiFID II to determine the scope 
of the ancillary activity exemption and which is defined in Article 4(1)(7) of MiFID II.  
As a consequence, a liquidity provider under Article 2(4)(c) of MiFID II in addition to providing 
liquidity on a continuous basis  and being willing to deal on own account against its proprietary 
capital has to be under genuine obligations to carry out transactions. Such obligations have to 
be specified in advance by the trading venue and have to be the subject of an enforceable 
agreement  between  the  trading  venue  and  the  liquidity  provider.  The  obligations  a  trading 
venue requires liquidity providers to fulfil have to be transparent to other market participants 
and be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. 
27 
 
 
 
 
The obligations of any liquidity provider have to go clearly beyond the activities of any ordinary 
market participant providing liquidity in a more general sense by simply trading on the market. 
The obligations should contain elements such as or comparable to quoting requirements  with 
a  maximum  spread,  a  minimum  volume,  a  minimum  quote  duration  and,  depending  on  the 
trading model, a maximum response time to provide quotes and a minimum participation rate. 
Only  transactions  executed  under  these  obligations  should  be  considered  as  privileged 
transactions. 
 
Question 9 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
Should the capital employed test be calculated only on the same positions as included in the 
market size test or for all commodity derivatives traded in the group? 
Answer 9 
Article 3(1) b) RTS 207 refers to the estimated capital employed for those activities referred to 
in Article 1 of RTS 20. According to Article 3(3) RTS 20 the size of the activities referred to in 
Article 1 shall be calculated by aggregating the size of the activities with respect to all of the 
asset  classes  referred  to  in  Article  2(1).  Accordingly,  the  numerator  of  the  capital  test  is 
calculated on the basis of the same positions as included in the market size test as only those 
asset classes referred to in Article 2(1) shall be included. 
 
Question 10 [Last update: 02/10/2018] *modified* 
Should the denominator in  the capital test  under Article 3(9) of RTS 20  be calculated using 
consolidated accounts? Should firms use capital on a worldwide basis or just capital employed 
within the EU? 
Answer 10 
The RTS 20 capital test should be calculated using consolidated accounts. According to Article 
3(9) of RTS 20, the capital employed for carrying out the main business of a group shall be the 
sum of the total assets of the group minus its short-term debt as recorded in the consolidated 
financial statements of the group at the end of the relevant annual calculation period. 
Firms shall use capital employed on a worldwide basis when calculating the capital test. 
 
                                                
7 Commission  delegated  regulation  (EU)  2017/592  of  1  December  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the European 
Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  regulatory  technical  standards  for  the  criteria  to  establish  when  an  activity  is 
considered to be ancillary to the main business 
28 
 
 
 
 
Question 11 [Last update: 04/10/2017] 
How should various underlyings falling under the C(10) category be treated for the purpose of 
ancillary activity calculations? 
Answer 11 
The various commodity derivative underlyings within the scope of the C(10) category shall be 
treated  consistently  across  all  provisions  concerning  commodity  derivatives  in  the  MiFID 
II/MiFIR framework. Therefore, all those commodity derivative contracts with underlyings that 
are subject to the position limit regime as specified in Position Limits Error! Reference source 
not  found.  should  also  be  counting  towards  the  ancillary  activity  test  calculations.  Other 
contracts within the C(10) scope should not be counted.  
 
Question 12 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
How shall transactions concluded on venues outside the EU be treated for the market size test 
computations under Article 2 of RTS 20?  
Answer 12 
Transactions  concluded  on  non-EU  venues  should  not  be  included  in  either  numerator  or 
denominator of the market size test, since those transactions do not constitute part of trading 
activity in the Union. 
 
Question 13 [Last update: 02/10/2018] *modified* 
How shall OTC transactions done by non-EU entities of an EU group with EU counterparties 
be counted for the market size test? 
Answer 13 
For the purpose of calculating the numerator, these transactions would be considered to take 
place in the EU and therefore should be included in the numerator of both the group that has 
an EU presence and the EU counterparty.  
For the purpose of the denominator, these transactions would also be considered to take place 
in the EU. 
Question 14 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
RTS  20  refers  only  to  Article  360  of the  CRR,  while  the  ‘simplified  approach  for  calculating 
regulatory capital requirements’ is contained in CRR Articles 357, 358 and 360. Is the text in 
RTS 20 self-contained or should firms refer to the whole of CRR? 
29 
 
 
 
 
Answer 14 
Article 3(5)(6)(7) of RTS 20 replicates the content of Articles 360(1) and 357(3) of Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013 of 26 June 2013 (CRR). RTS 20 contains the stand-alone test that needs 
to be performed without firms having to refer to the rest of the articles that relate to commodity 
derivatives  in  the  CRR.  However,  firms  may  find  it  useful  to  refer  to  the  EBA  Q&A  on 
clarification of the treatment of positions in commodities for the purposes of calculating net and 
gross positions according to Article 360(1) of CRR. 
 
4  Position reporting [Last update: 02/10/2018] 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Do positions held by an investment firm on behalf of their clients add to the investment firm’s 
own positions? 
Answer 1 
Article  57(1)  explicitly  introduces  the  possibility  that  positions  are  held  on  behalf  of  another 
entity for legal or operational reasons. In order to avoid double counting, such positions are 
only to be reported as the positions of the person on whose behalf they are held. They are not 
to be added to or netted against other positions held by the investment firm. 
 
Question 2 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
How  should  investment  firms  report  the  positions  in  commodity  derivatives  of  persons  who 
receive investment or ancillary services from a non-investment firm that is an “end client” of 
the investment firm? 
Answer 2 
As position limits apply to “persons”, all positions in commodity derivatives must be included 
in position reporting. Where an investment firm is reporting the positions of an end client that 
is not an investment firm and does not therefore have reporting obligations of its own under 
MIFID II, its report should cover both the end-client’s own account positions and any positions 
that the end-client holds on behalf of third parties.  
Investment  firms  reporting  such  positions  will  reduce  the  risk  of  their  reports  erroneously 
identifying a breach of the position limit by the end-client by reporting the position of the end 
client separately from positions held by that end-client on behalf of third parties. 
30 
 
 
 
 
Further, by reporting the positions held by the end-client on behalf of third party entities on an 
entity-by-entity basis the investment firm will further reduce the risks of its reports erroneously 
identifying  positions  which  appear  to  give  rise  to  breaches  because  they  aggregate  across 
unaffiliated entities.  
Entity-by-entity  reporting  is  therefore  encouraged,  though  ESMA  recognises  that  the 
investment  firm  may  not  be  able  to  disaggregate  end-client’s  positions,  and  there  is  no 
obligation on non-investment firms to provide disaggregated positions.  
Every person holding a position in commodity derivative is subject to the position limits even if 
their positions are aggregated in the reporting process. 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Who should submit position reports under Article 58(2) of MiFID II? 
Answer 3 
Only investment firms trading in commodity derivatives or emission allowances or derivatives 
thereof  outside  a  trading  venue  (economically  equivalent  OTC  contracts)  should  submit 
position reports under Article 58(2) of MiFID II. 
 
Question 4 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Should  investment  firms  include  positions  traded  on  a  trading  venue  and  economically 
equivalent OTC contracts in position reports under Article 58(2) of MiFID II? 
Answer 4 
Investment firms should only include economically equivalent OTC contracts in position reports 
under Article 58(2) MiFID II, as positions traded on trading venues are already reported under 
Article 58(1)(b) MiFID II. 
 
Question 5 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Does the requirement for trading venues to make public weekly aggregate position reports and 
to  communicate  that  report  to  the  competent  authority  and  to  ESMA  apply  to  securitised 
derivatives? 
Answer 5 
31 
 
 
 
 
The weekly aggregate position reports to be published by trading venues under Article 58(1)(a) 
of MiFID II aim at providing transparency to investors about the view of the market that certain 
categories  of  traders  may  be  taking.  As  an  example,  if  non-commercial  traders  are 
predominantly  long  in  grain  futures,  this  would  be  indicative  of  a  view  among  professional 
investors that grain prices are going to go up. 
Providing this type of transparency to investors appears useful and meaningful with regards to 
contracts  for  instance  with  large  open  interest  that  serve  as  a  reference  or  benchmark  for 
market participants. 
In  contrast, trading  in  European  securitised  derivatives  is  fragmented  with  well  over  10,000 
instruments  in  issue  and  liquidity  per  contract  is  often  low.  The  potential  publication  of  a 
multitude of weekly reports in securitised commodity derivatives on a per security level when 
position holder thresholds are exceeded would send out a confusing picture to investors rather 
than serve the envisaged purpose of market-wide transparency.  
ESMA also notes that under Article 83 of  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 
of 25 April 2016, the obligation for a trading venue to make public weekly aggregate position 
reports applies “when both of the following two thresholds are met:   
  20 open position holders exist in a given contract on a given trading venue; and   
 
the absolute amount of the gross long or short volume of total open interest, ex-pressed 
in the number of lots of the relevant commodity derivative, exceeds a level of four times 
the deliverable supply in the same commodity derivative, expressed in number of lots.    
Where the commodity derivative does not have a physically deliverable underlying asset and 
for emission allowances and derivatives thereof, point (b) shall not apply.” 
While  the  condition  of  20  position  holders  could  be  applied  to  securitised  derivatives,  the 
terminology of condition (b) referring to long or short volumes of open interest expressed in 
lots appears to be geared solely towards the contracts described in MiFID II, Annex I, Section 
C (5), (6), (7) and (10). 
Based on the above, ESMA is of the view that Article 58(1)(a) of MiFID II and the Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 dealing with weekly position reports does not apply to 
securitised derivatives. 
 
Question 6 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
At what level should Asset Managers aggregate positions? Is this to be done at group level or 
a lower level (e.g. fund/legal entity identifier etc.)? 
Answer 6 
32 
 
 
 
 
Under Article 4 (2) of RTS 21, as an exception to the general rule on calculating positions for 
legal  entities  within  a  group,  the  parent  undertaking  of  a  collective  investment  undertaking 
(CIU),  or  of  the  management  company  of  a  collective  investment  scheme,  should  not 
aggregate  the  positions  in  commodity  derivatives  in  any  collective  investment  undertaking 
where it does not in any way influence the investment decisions in respect of opening, holding 
or  closing  those  positions.  In  that  case,  positions  are  to  be  reported  at  CIU/LEI  level. 
Alternatively,  if  the  parent  undertaking  influences  investment  decisions  by  the  collective 
investment  undertaking  or  by  the  management  company  of  a  collective  investment 
undertaking,  it  should  aggregate  the  positions  held  in  the  relevant  collective  investment 
scheme(s). 
The  parent  undertaking  has  to  conduct  a  self-assessment  exercise  to  determine  whether  it 
exercises any influence on investment decisions by the collective investment undertaking or 
by the management company of a collective investment undertaking, taking into account any 
relevant circumstances governing the relationship between the parent undertaking and the CIU 
or its management company. 
Upon  request,  the  parent  undertaking  should  be  in  a  position  to  explain  to  the  relevant 
competent authority why it deems it does not exercise any influence on the decisions of the 
CIU or its management company. 
 
Question 7 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Which MIC should be used by trading venues for position reporting? 
Answer 7 
Venues should use the relevant ‘segment MIC’ under which a commodity derivative is traded. 
If a venue does not have a segment MIC, it should use its ‘operating MIC’.  
 
Question 8 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
By when do positions have to be reported under Articles 58(1)(b) and 58(2) of MIFID II? 
Answer 8 
Trading venues and investment firms should report their positions to the respective NCA by 
22:00 CET on T+1. 
 
Question 9 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
33 
 
 
 
 
Does the requirement under Article 58(1)(b) and (2) of MiFID II to submit daily position reports 
to  the  NCA  apply  to  securitised  derivatives  with  a  total  number  of  securities  in  issue  not 
exceeding 2.5 million? 
Answer 9 
No. The NCAs do not need to require the submission of daily position reports of securitised 
derivatives with a total number of securities in issue not exceeding 2.5 million. The purpose of 
daily reporting is to monitor for potential breaches of position limits. To that end, Article 58(3) 
of MiFID II stipulates that daily position reporting shall enable monitoring of compliance with 
Article 57(1) of MiFID II. Accordingly, the reporting requirement has been set for situations in 
which reporting is necessary to enable monitoring. As a consequence, NCAs do not need to 
require daily reporting if the possibility of a breach of position limits can be ruled out from the 
outset. 
These  instruments  would  be  illiquid  contracts  and  benefit  from  the  derogation  pursuant  to 
Article 15(1)(c) of RTS 21 with regard to regulatory technical standards for the application of 
position limits to commodity derivatives. For issues not exceeding 2.5 million securities it is per 
se not possible to breach position limits.  
Trading venues that would otherwise be required to submit position reports of these securitised 
derivatives must confirm to the NCA that the total number of securities in issue does not exceed 
the 2.5 million threshold. The NCA assesses whether this condition is fulfilled. The reporting 
entity can rely on information provided by the CSD, the issuer, or another reliable source that 
ensures up-to-date knowledge on the current number of securities in issue. As soon as the 
threshold is exceeded, position reporting must be performed. 
 
Question 10 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
How does ESMA propose to address the breaches of applicable non-EU laws and regulations 
regarding data protection and bank secrecy which may potentially arise from the reporting of 
client and end client positions? 
Answer 10 
Article 58(2) of MiFID II requires investment firms trading in commodity derivatives to provide 
to the relevant competent authority a complete breakdown of their positions as well as those 
of their clients and the clients of those clients until the end-client is reached. ITS 4 provides a 
template for such reporting. Position holders are to be identified in the same way as for trans-
action  reporting  purposes.  Legal  persons  are  identified  by  their  LEI.  For  non-EU  position 
holders that are natural persons, the identifier with the highest priority is the passport number, 
the  second  priority  being  a  unique  CONCAT  code  combining  nationality,  first  name  and 
surname of the position holder. 
34 
 
 
 
 
The requirement to identify clients and clients of clients until the end client in position reports 
cannot be waived. Therefore, where an investment firm would be dealing with or on behalf of 
clients  or  clients  of  clients  that  cannot  be  identified  in  position  reporting  because  of  legal, 
regulatory or contractual impediments, that investment firm would not be deemed compliant 
with its obligations under Article 58(2) of MiFID II. 
 
Question 11 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
Where an NFE trades only, or partly, for hedging purposes, can every transaction be reported 
as being for speculative purposes? 
Answer 11 
No. NFEs should ensure that their position reports accurately describe their position. This is 
necessary to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the position reports submitted to NCAs and 
the  published  weekly  position  reports.  Accordingly,  NFEs  are  expected  to  correctly  flag 
positions as hedging (or speculative) based on the conditions established in Article 7 of RTS 
21. In particular, the reports should accurately describe whether the position is risk reducing in 
relation to the NFE’s commercial activities. This is the case even if the NFE does not apply for 
a hedging exemption under Article 8 of RTS 21 (in accordance with Q&A 14 on position limits) 
because it does not expect its aggregated positions resulting from hedging and non-hedging 
activities to exceed the limit set by the relevant NCA for that commodity derivative contract. 
 
Question 12 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
Should an investment firm acting as broker and using a matched principal model be subject to 
position reporting? 
Answer 12 
Yes. Any investment firm trading in commodity derivatives contracts traded on a trading venue 
or  in  EEOTC  contracts  is  subject  to  position  reporting  and  should  provide  a  complete 
breakdown of positions held on own account and on behalf of clients as the investment firm 
can end up holding a position even if trading on a matched principal basis. It is the investment 
firm’s  responsibility  to  assess  whether  the  transaction  executed  results  in  a  change  in  the 
positions held on own account and/or on behalf of clients. 
 
Question 13 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
Do end-of-day zero positions need to be reported? 
Answer 13 
35 
 
 
 
 
Article  58(2)  of  MiFID  II  provides  for  the  reporting,  at  least  on  a  daily  basis,  of  a  complete 
breakdown of the positions. End of day zero positions do not need to be reported to the NCA 
unless the firm showed a positive or negative position in the previous report. In that case, the 
first time the open position is reduced to zero, a zero position should be reported to the NCA. 
 
Question 14 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
Can position reporting pursuant to Article 58(2) be outsourced to another entity?  
Answer 14 
Yes. Investment firms can delegate the reporting to third parties but shall remain responsible 
for the reports. The investment firm has to comply with the relevant outsourcing requirements 
specified in MiFID II. 
 
Question 15 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
Do positions in C(10) instruments with an underlying which is not a commodity as defined in 
Article 2(6) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016 need to be 
reported?  
Answer 15 
The various commodity derivative underlyings within the scope of the C(10) category shall be 
treated  consistently  across  all  provisions  concerning  commodity  derivatives  in  the  MiFID 
II/MiFIR framework.  
The purpose of daily reporting is to monitor for potential breaches of position limits as Article 
58(3) of MiFID II stipulates that daily position reporting shall enable monitoring of compliance 
with  Article  57(1)  of  MiFID  II.  Therefore,  all  those  commodity  derivatives  contracts  with 
underlyings that are subject to the position limit regime as specified in Position Limits Question 
10 and Ancillary Activity Question 11 are also subject to position reporting. 
 
Question 16 [Last update: 13/11/2017] 
In respect of which contracts does ESMA expect to receive weekly reporting data from trading 
venues under Article 58(7) of MiFID II in conjunction with ITS 4 and 5?  
Answer 16 
Submission of weekly reports to ESMA should be strictly limited to those contracts that fulfil 
the conditions specified in Article 83 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 
36 
 
 
 
 
25  April  2016.  This  is  to  ensure  that  ESMA  only  publishes  those  reports  it  is  authorised  to 
publish  and  that  the  ESMA  publications  give  a  consistent  picture  to  stakeholders.  Trading 
venues can publish on their own webpages information in respect of additional contracts. 
 
Question 17 [Last update: 15/12/2017] 
Where  there  is  a  chain  of  investment  firms  that  have  to  comply  with  commodity  position 
reporting obligations, who has to report to the trading venue or NCA? 
Answer 17 
Where there is a chain of investment firms that are executing trades on behalf of their clients, 
each one of them has an obligation to report a complete breakdown of the positions held by 
all persons down the chain, down to the end client, as defined under Article 58(3) of MIFID II. 
At the same time, duplicative reporting should be avoided. Unless firms make arrangements 
to avoid it, this may arise, for example, where two or more of the investment firms in the chain 
are  members  of  a  trading  venue,  and  therefore  have  an  obligation  (under  Article  58(3))  to 
report to the trading venue. 
To this aim, there is a possibility to outsource reporting, for example, an arrangement in which 
the first investment firm in a chain will agree with the second that it will report to the trading 
venue. The firm which outsources the reporting should make sure that all the necessary and 
factual information is provided to the reporting agent, as the responsibility for reporting cannot 
be outsourced.  
 
Question 18 [Last update: 15/12/2017] 
How should clients of investment firms inform their intermediaries of the nature of each of their 
positions  (hedge  or  speculation)?  Should  that  information  be  provided  for  each  position  or 
could  clients  indicate  to  their  intermediaries  that,  except  if  they  explain  otherwise,  all  their 
positions should be deemed for hedging or non-hedging purposes? 
Answer 18 
The obligation to report positions under Article 58 of MIFID rests with members or participants 
of  regulated  markets,  MTFs  and  clients  of  OTFs  or  with  investment  firms  when  executing 
EEOTC transactions on behalf of their clients.  
It  is  the  client’s  responsibility  to  ensure  that  their  position  is  accurately  described  in  their 
position report, in particular regarding whether their positions are for hedging or speculative 
purposes. It is a matter for the individual client as to how they satisfy this obligation and they 
may provide an initial instruction that unless informed otherwise, the investment firm should 
report certain defined positions to be for hedging (or speculative) purposes providing that this 
37 
 
 
 
 
is an accurate description at the time. There may, however, be circumstances where a client 
is able more accurately to assign new transactions to hedging or speculative positions only 
after the initial trade. In this case the client should ensure that their position report is adjusted 
accordingly to the hedging or non-hedging nature of their position. Some clients may find it 
useful to adopt the ITS 4 template for reporting to investment firms. 
 
Question 19 [Last update: 15/12/2017] 
How  is  the  position  quantity  field  reported  for  contracts  that  relate  to  delivery  of  the  same 
underlying over different periods of time? 
 
 
Answer 19 
The  Position  Quantity  held  in  a  contract  must  be  reported  in  the  same  unit  as  used  by  the 
Competent  Authority  to  set  the  position  limit  for  that  contract.  The  position  limits  for  those 
contracts that refer to the same underlying commodity but have a variety of delivery periods, 
e.g.  annual  (calendar),  quarterly,  monthly,  weekly  (whole  week,  working  day  week  and 
weekend)  or  daily  are  set  in  units  of  underlying  since  a  lot  does  not  represent  a  standard 
quantity  of  underlying  across  all  maturities/delivery  periods.  Thus,  for  these  contracts,  the 
figures reported in the field position quantity must be expressed in units of underlying. 
 
Question 20 [Last update: 15/12/2017] 
How should the position in the spot month and other months be reported for contracts where 
there are daily or weekly as well as monthly contracts? 
Answer 20 
Positions in daily or weekly contracts whose delivery period is completely included in the spot 
month should be reported as spot month positions ('SPOT').  
Positions  in  weekly  contracts  whose  delivery  period  is  not  completely  included  in  the  spot 
month, i.e. weekly contracts that straddle the spot month and other months, should be reported 
as other months’ positions ('OTHR'). 
Positions in quarterly or annual contracts whose delivery period straddles the spot month and 
other months should also be reported as other months’ positions ('OTHR').

Question 21 [Last update: 27/03/2018] 
In cases where an OTC contract is economically equivalent to more than one ETD contract 
traded on an EU trading venue and where those ETD contracts are not the same derivative 
contract, to which NCA should the reporting of the EEOTC contracts be addressed? 
Answer 21 
In cases where an OTC contract is economically equivalent to more than one ETD contract 
traded on a trading venue in the EU and where those ETD contracts do not qualify as the same 
derivative contract in accordance with Article 5(1) of RTS 21, positions in the EEOTC contract 
can be reported to any of the NCAs of the trading venues where the ETD contract is traded. 
Position  reporting  of  such  EEOTC  contract  should  not  be  split  among  different  NCAs  and 
should  not  be  reported  to  more  than  one  NCA.  Investment  firms  should  ensure  that  non-
reporting or double reporting is avoided and that EEOTC contracts are consistently reported 
to the same NCA, with a consistent reference to the contract. 
For  aggregation  purposes,  in  order  to  calculate  “net  positions”  according  to  Article  57(1)  of 
MIFID II and Article 3 of RTS 21, the EEOTC contract should be considered only once and be 
aggregated  only  once  with  the  ETD  contract  that  the  investment  firm  has  considered  it  is 
equivalent to. 
 
Question 22 [Last update: 02/10/2018] *New* 
Which  types  of  firm  fall  within  each  of  the  ITS  4  categories  for  the  purposes  of  the  weekly 
Commitment of Trader (CoT) reports? 
Answer 22 
ITS 4 implementing MiFID II provides the format of the weekly CoT report to be published by 
trading venues and provided to ESMA. In providing information to the trading venues to enable 
them to  produce the  CoT  report,  members  and participants  of those  venues must  use their 
knowledge  and  judgment  to  categorise  their  activities  and  the  activities  of  their  clients 
accurately.  
In  order  to  achieve  accuracy  and  consistency  in  the  reporting  of  positions  across  different 
categories, the following guidance may be of assistance: 
 
 
 
 
Investment firms or credit institutions – includes banks and other firms regulated under 
MiFID II. 
Investment funds – entities holding investments directly in the commodity derivatives 
market  as  a  form  of  collective  investment  scheme,  including  hedge,  pension  and 
exchange-traded funds. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Other  financial  institutions  –  those  financial  firms  not  falling  within  any  of  the  other 
categories.  
  Commercial  undertakings  –  non-financial  entities  using  commodity  derivatives,  for 
example firms using those markets to hedge the risk they directly incur from dealing in 
physical  commodities  such  as  producers,  end  users,  processors,  manufacturers, 
shippers and merchants. 
  Operators  with  compliance  obligations  under  the  Emissions  Allowance  Trading 
Directive – such as commercial airlines, entities in power and heat generation, energy-
intensive  industry  sectors  including  oil  refineries,  steel  works,  production  of  iron, 
aluminium, metals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids and 
bulk organic chemicals.  
 
It should be noted that it is possible for a firm to be categorised as an operator with compliance 
obligations under the Emissions Allowance Trading Directive for a Weekly CoT report for an 
emissions  allowance  contract  or  derivatives  thereof  while,  on  the  other  hand,  it  must  be 
categorised as a commercial undertaking for a Weekly CoT referring to another asset class of 
commodity derivatives contract (i.e. metals, oil, coal, gas, power, etc.).  
 
5  Position management controls [Last update: 04/10/2017] 
Question 1 [Last update: 04/10/2017] 
Are position management controls required to play a role in the application of position limits 
applied by NCAs according to Article 57(1) MiFID II? 
Answer 1 
No. NCAs are responsible for the application of position limits established under Article 57(1). 
Recital (128) MiFID further specifies that the powers to require the reduction or termination of 
a  position  or  to  provide  back  liquidity  should  “mitigate  the  effects  of  a  large  or  dominant 
position”.  
However, the controls listed in Article 57(8) are not exhaustive and shall not prevent trading 
venues  from  developing  their  own  position  limits  as  a  mean  to  control  positions  held  on 
commodity derivatives traded on their trading venues.  
 
6  Third country issues [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
Question 1 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
40 
 
 
 
 
Should  economically  equivalent  contracts  traded  on  a  third-country  venue  be  considered 
EEOTC for position limit and position reporting purposes under MiFID II? 
Answer 1 
Whether  or  not  positions  held  in  commodity  derivatives  contracts  traded  on  third-country 
venues that are economically equivalent (EE) to contracts traded on an EU trading venue, are 
to  be  considered  as  EETOC  for  position  limit  and  position  reporting  purposes  under  Article 
58(2) of MiFID II depends on the characteristics of that third-country trading venue, as set out 
in ESMA Opinion 70-154-466 of 15 December 20178. 
Market participants holding positions on third country venue contracts, that may be considered 
EEOTC under Article 58(2) of MiFID II and Article 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2017/591  of  1  December  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the application 
of  position  limits  to  commodity  derivatives  (RTS  21),  or  considering  trading  such  contracts, 
should contact their CA and make them aware of those contracts. The CA will then get in touch 
with the third-country venue with a request for further information. Based on the information 
provided, ESMA will determine whether the third-country trading venue meets the criteria set 
out in the ESMA Opinion. If so, the respective third-country venue will be listed in an Annex to 
the Opinion. 
Where a third-country trading venue appears in the annex to the Opinion, EE contracts traded 
on that venue will not be considered EEOTC for position limit and position reporting purposes. 
EE contracts traded on any other third-country trading venue that does not appear in the Annex 
to the Opinion will be considered EEOTC. 
ESMA is aware that it is important for market participants to have legal certainty as soon as 
possible on the treatment of their transactions in EE contracts on third-country trading venues 
for position limit and reporting purposes. Whilst ESMA cannot commit to any set timeline for 
the assessment of the information received through NCAs, all notifications will be processed 
as expediently as possible.
