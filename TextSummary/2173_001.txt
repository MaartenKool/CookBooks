I. Background 
1.  The  Alternative  Investment  Fund  Managers  Directive  (AIFMD)  puts  in  place  a 
comprehensive framework for the regulation of alternative investment fund managers 
within  Europe.  The  extensive  requirements  with  which  AIFMs  must  comply  are 
designed to  ensure  that these managers can manage  AIFs  on  a cross-border  basis 
and the AIFs that they manage can be sold on a cross-border basis.  
2.  The AIFMD framework is made up of the following EU legislation:  
  Directive 2011/61/EU1, which was adopted in 2011. It is a ‘framework’ Level 1 
technical  delegated  and 
Directive  which  has  been  supplemented  by 
implementing measures.  
  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  No  231/2013 2 ,  Commission  Regulation  (EU) 
No 447/20133,  Commission  Regulation  (EU)  No  448/20134,  and  Commission 
Regulation (EU) No 694/20145. 
3.  ESMA is required to play an active role in building a common supervisory culture by 
promoting common supervisory approaches and practices. In this regard, the Authority 
develops Q&As as and when appropriate to elaborate on the provisions of certain EU 
legislation or ESMA guidelines.  
4.  The European Commission has already published its own Q&A on AIFMD6.  
II. Purpose 
5.  The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  promote  common  supervisory  approaches  and 
practices in the application of the AIFMD and its implementing measures. It does this 
by  providing  responses  to  questions  posed  by  the  general  public  and  competent 
authorities in relation to the practical application of the AIFMD.  
6.  The content of this document is aimed at competent authorities under AIFMD to ensure 
that  in  their  supervisory  activities  their  actions  are  converging  along  the  lines  of  the 
responses adopted by ESMA. However, the answers are also intended to help AIFMs

by providing clarity as to the content of the AIFMD rules, rather than creating an extra 
layer of requirements. 
III. Status  
7.  The  Q&A  mechanism  is  a  practical  convergence  tool  used  to  promote  common 
supervisory approaches and practices under Article 29(2) of the ESMA Regulation.7  
8.  Therefore,  due  to  the  nature  of  Q&As,  formal  consultation  on  the  draft  answers  is 
considered unnecessary. However, even if they are not formally consulted on, ESMA 
may check them with representatives of ESMA’s Securities and Markets Stakeholder 
Group,  the  relevant  Standing  Committees’  Consultative  Working  Group  or,  where 
specific expertise is needed, with other external parties. 
9.  ESMA  will review these questions and answers on a regular basis to identify if, in a 
certain area, there is a need to convert some of the material into ESMA guidelines. In 
such cases, the procedures foreseen under Article 16 of the ESMA Regulation will be 
followed.  
IV. Questions and answers  
10. This  document  is  intended  to  be  continually  edited  and  updated  as  and  when  new 
questions  are  received.  The  date  each  question  was  last  amended  is  included  after 
each question for ease of reference.

Section I: Remuneration 
Date last updated: 27 June 2014 
Question  1  [last  update  17  February  2014]:  To  which  accounting  period  should  AIFMs 
performing activities under the AIFMD before 22 July 2013 and submitting an application for 
authorisation  under  the  AIFMD  between  22  July  2013  and  22  July  2014  apply  the  AIFMD 
remuneration rules for the first time?  
Answer 1: Paragraph 4 of the Guidelines on sound remuneration policies under the AIFMD 
(ESMA/2013/232) (the Remuneration Guidelines) states that “These Guidelines apply from 22 
July 2013, subject to the transitional provisions of the AIFMD”. The Commission Q&A on the 
AIFMD  provided  specific  guidance  on  the  interpretation  of  the  transitional  provisions  under 
Article 61(1) of the AIFMD.8  
According to Article 61(1) of the AIFMD, AIFMs performing activities under the AIFMD before 
22 July 2013 have one year from that date to submit an application for authorisation. Once a 
firm becomes  authorised  under  the  AIFMD,  it  becomes  subject  to  the  AIFMD  remuneration 
rules and the Remuneration Guidelines. Therefore, the relevant rules should start applying as 
of the date of authorisation. 
However, as for the rules on variable remuneration (i.e. the ones for which guidance is provided 
under  Sections  XI.  (Guidelines  on  the  general  requirements  on  risk  alignment)  and  XII. 
(Guidelines on the specific requirements on risk alignment) of the Remuneration Guidelines), 
AIFMs should apply them for the calculation of payments relating to new awards of variable 
remuneration  to  their  identified  staff  (as  defined  in  the  Remuneration  Guidelines)  for 
performance periods following that in which they become authorised. So the AIFMD regime on 
variable remuneration should apply only to full performance periods and should first apply to 
the first full performance period after the AIFM becomes authorised. For example: 
1.  An existing AIFM whose accounting period ends on 31 December and which obtained 
an authorisation between 22 July 2013 and 31 December  2013: the AIFMD rules on 
variable remuneration should apply to the calculation of payments relating to the 2014 
accounting period. 
2.  An  existing  AIFM  whose  accounting  period  ends  on  31  December  obtains  an 
authorisation between 1 January 2014 and 22 July 2014: the AIFMD rules on variable 
remuneration  should  apply  to  the  calculation  of  payments  relating  to  the  2015 
accounting period.  
However, for an existing AIFM whose accounting period ends on 31 December which submits 
an application for authorisation by 22 July 2014 and obtains an authorisation after that date 
(including when the authorisation is obtained after 31 December 2014), the AIFMD rules on 
                                                
8 ID 1180. Transitional provisions, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/yqol/index.cfm?fuseaction=question.show&questionId=1180.

variable  remuneration  should  apply  to  the  calculation  of  payments  relating  to  the  2015 
accounting period. 
Question 2 [last update 17 February 2014]: To which accounting period should AIFMs not 
performing  activities  under  the  AIFMD  before  22  July  2013  and  obtaining  an  authorisation 
under the AIFMD after 22 July 2013 apply the remuneration rules for the first time? 
Answer  2:  Once  a  firm  becomes  authorised  under  the  AIFMD,  it  becomes  subject  to  the 
AIFMD  remuneration  rules  and  the  Remuneration  Guidelines  and  the  relevant  rules  should 
start to apply as of the date of authorisation. 
However, as for the rules on variable remuneration (i.e. the ones for which guidance is provided 
under  Sections  XI.  (Guidelines  on  the  general  requirements  on  risk  alignment)  and  XII. 
(Guidelines on the specific requirements on risk alignment) of the Remuneration Guidelines), 
AIFMs should apply them for the calculation of payments relating to new awards of variable 
remuneration  to  their  identified  staff  (as  defined  in  the  Remuneration  Guidelines)  for 
performance periods following that in which they submit an application for authorisation. An 
AIFM submitting an application for authorisation in the year N (after 22 July 2013), should apply 
the AIFMD remuneration regime on variable remuneration only to the calculation of payments 
relating to the accounting period for year N+1. 
Question 3 [last update 17 February 2014]: Which staff of the delegate should be covered 
by  the  “appropriate  contractual  arrangements”  that  ensure  there  is  no  circumvention  of  the 
remuneration rules as set out in paragraph 18(b) of the Remuneration Guidelines?  
Answer 3: Such contractual arrangements must only be in place in respect of the delegate’s 
identified  staff  who  have  a  material  impact  on  the  risk  profiles  of  the  AIFs  it  manages  as  a 
result of the delegation, and only in respect of the remuneration for such delegated activities. 
Question 4 [last update 17 February 2014]: In a delegation arrangement where the delegate 
is  subject  to  the  CRD  rules,  can  the  delegate  be  considered  to  be  subject  to  regulatory 
requirements  on  remuneration  that  are  equally  as  effective  as  those  applicable  under  the 
Remuneration Guidelines? 
Answer 4: Provided that the staff of these entities who are identified staff for the purpose of 
the  Remuneration  Guidelines  are  subject  to  the  CRD  rules,  these  entities  are  subject  to 
regulatory  requirements  on  remuneration  that  are  equally  as  effective  as  those  applicable 
under the Guidelines. 
Question 5 [last update 27 June 2014]: Can AIFMs choose to exclude portfolio managers 
from  the  scope  of  identified  staff  for  the  purpose  of  the  Remuneration  Guidelines  purely 
because they are bound by investment limits set out by law and/or internal risk limits set out in 
the investment restrictions of the AIF? 
Answer 5: No. Paragraph 20 of the Remuneration Guidelines provides for a presumption that 
certain  categories  of  staff  should  be  included  as  the  identified  staff.  ‘Other  risk  takers’  are 
mentioned  among  these  categories  of  staff.  This  category  includes  ‘staff  members,  whose 
6 
 
 
 
professional activities – either individually or collectively, as members of a group (e.g. a unit or 
part of a department) – can exert material influence on the AIFM’s risk profile or on an AIF it 
manages’.  When  assessing  whether  a  portfolio  manager  can  exert  material  influence,  a 
number of questions are relevant: 
1)  is the percentage size of the AIF portfolio being managed small?  
2)  is the portfolio manager required to meet (and outperform) a performance benchmark?  
3)  is the percentage deviation from that benchmark which is tolerated by the AIFM small?  
4)  does the AIFM monitor the performance of the portfolio manager daily?  
Where  the  answer  to  any  of the  above questions  is  ‘no’,  a  portfolio manager  is  likely  to fall 
within the scope of identified staff. Where the answer to all of the questions above it ‘yes’, a 
portfolio manager is more likely to fall outside the scope of identified staff. Given that the criteria 
are qualitative, it may still be the case that for some combinations of 1) and 3) above, a portfolio 
manager may still exert material influence on an AIFM’s risk profile or on an AIF it manages, 
in which case the Remuneration Guidelines should apply. 
Question  6  [last  update  5  October  2017]:  Do  the  remuneration-related  disclosure 
requirements under Article 22(2)(e) of the AIFMD also apply to the staff of the delegate of an 
AIFM to whom portfolio management or risk management activities have been delegated? 
Answer  6:  Yes.  In  line  with  the  approach  followed  under  the  AIFMD  Remuneration 
Guidelines9, AIFMs can ensure compliance in one of the following two ways: 
i) 
ii) 
where  the  delegate  is  subject  to  regulatory  requirements  on  remuneration 
disclosure for its staff to whom portfolio management or risk management activities 
have been delegated that are equally as effective as those under Article 22(2)(e) of 
the AIFMD, the AIFM should use the information disclosed by the delegate for the 
purposes of fulfilling its obligations under Article 22(e) of the AIFMD and Article 107 
of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation; or  
in other cases, appropriate contractual arrangements should be put in place with 
the delegate allowing the AIFM to receive (and disclose in the annual report for the 
relevant  AIF(s)  that  it  manages)  at  least  information  on  the  total  amount  of 
remuneration for the financial year, split into fixed and variable remuneration, paid 
by the AIF and/or the AIFM to the identified staff of the delegate – and number of 
beneficiaries, and, where relevant, carried interest – which is linked to the delegated 
portfolio. This means that the disclosure should be done on a prorated basis for the 
part  of  the  AIF’s  assets  which  are  managed  by  the  identified  staff  within  the 
delegate.  
                                                
9 See paragraph 18 of the AIFMD Remuneration Guidelines. 
7 
 
 
 
In both situations set out above, the disclosure may be provided on an aggregate basis i.e. by 
means of a total amount for all the delegates of the AIFM in relation to the relevant AIF.  
Question  7  [last  update  5  October  2017]:  Can  the  information  mentioned  under  Article 
22(2)(e)  and  (f)  of  the  AIFMD  be  disclosed  in  the  annual  report  by  the  way  of  a  link  to  a 
document where the relevant information is available? 
Answer 7: No. The information prescribed by Article 22(2)(e) and (f) of the AIFMD should be 
included in the annual report. This is without  prejudice to references in the annual report to 
other documents where additional information may be found.

Section II: Notifications of AIFs 
Date last updated: 7 April 2017 
Question 1 [last update 17 February 2014]: What additional information should be provided 
under letter (f) of Annex IV of the AIFMD? 
Answer  1:  Letter  (f)  of  Annex  IV  of  the  AIFMD  should  be  understood  as  requesting  all 
information set out in Article 23(1) of the AIFMD that is not already contained in Annex IV of 
the AIFMD. 
Question  2  [last  update  17  February  2014]:  Should  AIFMs  that  wish  to  market  new 
investment  compartments  of  AIFs  in  a  Member  State  where  these  AIFs have  been  already 
notified undertake a new notification procedure via their competent authority? 
Answer 2: Yes. 
Question 3 [last update 1 April 2016]: If an EU AIF decides to offer additional fund units to 
investors, and the offer is limited to the investors already invested in the AIF, does the AIFM 
have to submit a new notification to the national competent authority in accordance with Article 
31(2) of AIFMD? 
Answer 3: No. 
Question 4 [last update 3 June 2016]: For the purposes of Article 31 of AIFMD (marketing 
of units or shares of EU AIFs in the home Member State of the AIFM), does it make a difference 
whether the EU AIF to be marketed is domiciled in the home Member State of the EU AIFM or 
in another Member State? 
Answer 4: No. Article 31 does not differentiate between the marketing of EU AIFs domiciled 
in the home Member State of the AIFM and EU AIFs domiciled in another Member State. 
Question  5 [last  update  3  June  2016]:  Can  an  authorised  EU  AIFM,  in  its  home  Member 
State, market an EU feeder AIF with a non-EU master AIF pursuant to Article 31 of AIFMD? 
Answer 5: No. Article 31(1), second subparagraph, allows an EU AIFM to market an EU feeder 
AIF  in  the  home  Member  State  of  the  AIFM  as  long  as  it  has  an  EU  master  AIF  which  is 
managed by an authorised EU AIFM. Marketing of an EU feeder AIF with a non-EU master 
AIF is subject to Article 36(1) of AIFMD. 
Question 6 [last update 16 November 2016]: An AIF is marketed in a host Member State by 
way of the AIFMD marketing passport (Article 32 of AIFMD). A new share class of the AIF is 
set up, which will be marketed in the host Member State. Should this be regarded as a material 
change, which would require a new notification pursuant to Article 32? 
Answer 6: No. The creation of a share class, which is to be marketed cross-border within an 
already notified (sub-)fund, does not constitute a material change of the notification. 
9 
 
 
 
Question 7 [last update 16 November 2016]: An AIFM wishes to notify a material change to 
a notification made to the competent authorities in its home Member State to manage or market 
an  AIF  on  a  cross-border  basis  (Articles  32(7)  or  33(6)  of  AIFMD).  Does  the  AIFM  have  to 
include the full set of documentation required by Articles 32 or 33 in the notification letter? 
Answer 7: Yes. Material changes to existing notifications require the AIFM to hand in a full set 
of  documentation  with  the  revised  notification  letter.  AIFMs  are  asked  to  highlight  any 
amendment to the original notification letter and accompanying documentation. 
Question 8 [last update: 6 April 2017]: In addition to the AIFMD categories of “professional 
investor” and “retail investor”, a number of Member States have introduced further categories 
for  retail  investors  (such  as  “qualifying  investor”,  “informed  investor”,  or  “semi-professional 
investor”),  which,  by  their  definition,  share  some,  but  not  all  elements  of  the  definition  of 
“professional investor” pursuant to Article 4(1)(ag) of AIFMD. Does the AIF marketing passport 
(Article 32 of AIFMD) extend to those investors? 
Answer:  No.  The  AIF  marketing  passport  may  only  be  used  for  marketing  to  professional 
investors as defined in Article 4(1)(ag) of AIFMD. Any other cross-border marketing activity to 
non-professional  investors  as  defined  in  Member  States  has  to  be  notified  and  carried  out 
according to national legislation in the host Member State of the AIF and cannot be carried out 
by way of the AIF marketing passport.

Section III: Reporting to national competent authorities under Articles 3, 24 and 42 
Date last updated: 24 May 2017 
Question 1 [last update 16 December 2016]: When a non-EU AIFM reports information to 
the national competent authorities of a Member State under Article 42 of the AIFMD, which 
AIFs have to be included in the reports? 
Answer 1: When a non-EU AIFM reports information to the national competent authorities of 
a  Member  State  under Article  42,  only  the  AIFs marketed  in that  Member  State  have  to  be 
taken  into  account  for  the  purpose  of  the  reporting.  When  Member  States  apply  ESMA’s 
opinion on collection of additional information under Article 24(5) of the AIFMD, AIFMs should 
also report information on non-EU master AIFs not marketed in the EU that have either EU 
feeder AIFs or non-EU feeder AIFs marketed in the Union under Article 42.  Non-EU AIFMs 
should apply the same principle if the master AIF is established in the Union and not marketed 
in  the  Union  (i.e.  they  should  report  information  on  the  EU  master  AIF  not  marketed  in  the 
Union). 
Question 2 [last update 25 March 2014]: Should repurchase transactions (at the level of the 
portfolio of the AIF) by or on behalf of a reporting AIF be considered as financing operations 
for the  purpose  of the  AIFMD  reporting  obligations  (questions  54  –  56  and  210-  217  of  the 
consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer  2:  Yes.  Therefore,  AIFMs  should  take  into  account  the  counterparties  of  those 
transactions when reporting the information related to funding sources in questions 54  – 56 
and take into account the aggregate amount of these transactions in questions 210-217. 
Question 3 [last update 25 March 2014]: Which period should AIFMs use when reporting 
information  on  ‘Instruments  traded  and  individual  exposures’  (questions  121  to  124  of  the 
consolidated  reporting  template):  the  residual  maturity  of  the  instrument  or  the  maturity  at 
issuance? 
Answer 3: AIFMs should use the residual maturity as of the reporting date. 
Question  4  [last  update  25  March  2014]: What  should  be  the  basis  of  the  numerator  for 
calculating the geographical exposure as a percentage of the NAV of the AIF (question 78 to 
85 of the consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 4: The numerator used for calculating the geographical exposure as a percentage of 
the  net  asset  value  of  the  AIF  should  be  the  NAV  of  the  AIF  for  each  geographical  area. 
Therefore,  this  may  result  in  negative  values  for  certain  regions  but  the  total  should  equal 
100%. 
11 
 
 
 
Question 5 [last update 25 March 2014]: What should be the basis of the numerator and the 
denominator  for  calculating  the  geographical  exposure  as  a  percentage  of  the  aggregated 
value of the AIF (questions 86 to 93 of the consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 5: The numerator used for calculating the geographical exposure as a percentage of 
the aggregated value of the AIF should be the total value of assets under management of the 
AIF for each geographical area. The basis for the denominator should the total value of assets 
under management of the AIF. The total should equal 100%. 
Question  6  [last  update  25  March  2014]: What  should  be  the  basis  of  the  numerator  for 
calculating  the  breakdown  of  investment  strategies  as  a  percentage  of  the  NAV  of  the  AIF 
(question 60 of the consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 6: The numerator used for calculating the breakdown of investment strategies as a 
percentage of the NAV of the AIF should be the net asset value of the AIF for each investment 
strategy. Therefore, this may result in negative values for certain investment strategies but the 
total should equal 100%.  
Question 7 [last update 25 March 2014]: ESMA’s guidelines recommend that AIFMs submit 
the last report of the AIF immediately after it has been liquidated or put into liquidation. When 
should AIFMs submit this last report? 
Answer 7: AIFMs should submit the last AIF report not later than one month after the end of 
the quarter in which the AIF has been liquidated or put into liquidation. 
Question  8  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  percentage  of 
market value for securities traded on regulated markets and OTC markets (questions 148 and 
149 of the consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 8: AIFMs should aggregate the market value of all securities traded and report the 
percentage  of  the  market  value  of  securities  traded  on  a  regulated  exchange  and  OTC. 
Regulated exchanges include regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities and organised 
trading  facilities.  For  the  European  Union,  regulated  markets 10  and  multilateral  trading 
facilities 11 are  published  on  ESMA’s  website.  Securities  that  are  not  traded  on  regulated 
exchanges should be considered as traded OTC. This means that the total should equal 100%. 
Question  9  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  percentage  of 
trade volumes for derivatives traded on regulated markets and OTC markets (questions 150 
and 151 of the consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer  9:  AIFMs  should  take  into  account  the  total  number  of  trades  and  report  the

include regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities. For the 
European  Union,  regulated  markets 12  and  multilateral  trading  facilities 13  are  published  on 
ESMA’s website. Securities that are not traded on regulated exchanges should be considered 
as traded OTC. This means that the total should equal 100%. 
Question 10 [last update 25 March 2014]: How should AIFMs report the information on the 
liquidity portfolio when the AIF is invested in assets with no current liquidity for which it is not 
possible  to  determine  the  future  liquidity  (questions  178  -184  of  the  consolidated  reporting 
template)?  
Answer  10:  In  that  case,  AIFMs  should  adopt  a  conservative  approach  and  assign  the 
instrument to the longest period bucket. 
Question  11  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  the  information  on 
investor liquidity? 
Answer 11: AIFMs should divide the AIF’s NAV among the period buckets depending on the 
shortest  period  within  which  investors  are  entitled,  under  the  fund  documents,  to  withdraw 
invested funds or receive redemption payments, as applicable. 
For  example,  an  AIF  has  a  NAV  of  €  1,000,000  with  two  investors.  According  to  the  fund 
documents, investor A whose share of the NAV is €600,000 is entitled to withdraw 50% of its 
investment  on  a  daily  basis  and  50%  of  its  investments  between  2  and 7  days.  Investor  B, 
whose share of the NAV is €400,000, is entitled to withdraw 60% of its investments between 
31 and 90 days and 40% of its investment within 91 and 180 days. The investor profile of the 
AIF will be the following: 
1  day  or

Question  12  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  According  to  question  22  of  the  consolidated 
reporting template, AIFMs must  indicate the inception date of the AIF. What does inception 
date mean? 
Answer 12: If an AIF is subject to pre-authorisation, the inception date should be the date of 
authorisation. If an AIF is established without pre-authorisation by the competent authority, the 
inception date should be the date when the AIF was established. Finally, if the AIF is subject 
to  registration  obligation  at  national  level  with  its  competent  authority  after  the  date  of 
establishment, the inception date should be the date when the AIF was constituted.

Question 13 [last update 25 March 2014]: Should AIFMs report the information in English or 
in the language of the jurisdiction to which they report?  
Answer 13: Apart from the sections on assumptions and stress tests, where text is allowed, 
the rest of the information to be reported will consist of figures, predetermined values or names 
of  counterparties.  For  assumptions  and  stress  tests,  ESMA  recommends  that  the  national 
competent  authority  allow  AIFMs  to  report  the  information  in  English,  which  would  allow 
multinational  groups  to  centralise  and  harmonise  their  AIFMD  reporting.  However,  this  will 
depend on the national legislation transposing the AIFMD. 
Question 14 [last update 25 March 2014]: There are predetermined codes for the XML filing. 
Should these codes be translated into national languages? 
Answer 14: No. These codes are predetermined values that cannot be changed for the XML 
filing. 
Question  15 [last  update  25 March  2014]: Is  cash  resulting from  repurchase  agreements 
included in the amount of cash and cash equivalents to be reported by AIFMs under questions 
121 -124? 
Answer  15:  Yes. When  reporting  information  on  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  AIFMs  should 
include all amounts of cash held, including as a result of repurchase arrangements. 
Question  16  [last  update  25  March  2014]:  According  to  questions  163  and  164  of  the 
consolidated  reporting  template,  AIFMs  should  report  the  BIC  and  LEI  of  the  five  biggest 
counterparties to which an AIF has exposure. How should AIFMs identify those counterparties 
if they do not have such codes?  
Answer 16: In that case, AIFMs should only report the full name of the counterparty. 
Question 17 [last update 25 March 2014]: What information should AIFMs report for question 
137  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  when  they  do  not  have  an  expected  annual 
return/IRR in normal market conditions?  
Answer 17: In that case, AIFMs should report the value ‘N/A’ for non-applicable. 
Question 18 [last update 25 March 2014]: Must all AIFMs answer questions 296 to 301 of 
the consolidated reporting template? 
Answer 18: No. Only AIFMs managing AIFs employing leverage on a substantive basis must 
answer questions 296 to 301 of the consolidated reporting template. 
Question  19  [last  update  27  June  2014]:  Pursuant  to  questions  19  of  the  consolidated 
reporting template for AIF-specific information and 20 of the consolidated reporting template 
14 
 
 
 
for AIFM-specific information, AIFMs must specify whether the AIFs and the AIFMs are EEA 
AIFs and EEA AIFMs. Which countries are covered by the reference to “EEA”? 
Answer 19: EEA AIFs and EEA AIFMs should be understood as AIFs and AIFMs established 
in one of the 28 EU Member States or Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. 
Question  20 [last  update  27  June  2014]:  According  to  Article  24(2)  of the  AIFMD,  AIFMs 
must report specific information for all EU AIFs they manage or AIFs they market in the Union. 
Which countries are covered by the reference to “the Union”? 
Answer 20: The reference to the Union should be understood as including the 28 EU Member 
States and, once the AIFMD has been incorporated into the EEA agreement, Norway, Iceland 
and Liechtenstein. 
Question  21  [last  update  27  June  2014]:  The  technical  guidance  indicates  for  each 
information  item  whether  the  information  is  mandatory  (M),  optional  (O)  or  conditional  (C). 
What do these categories mean?  
Answer 21: Information marked as mandatory should be reported by all AIFMs. Information 
marked  as  optional  has  to  be  reported  if  the  AIFM  has  information  to  report.  For  example, 
question 10 of the reporting template (change in AIF reporting obligation frequency code) is 
marked as optional. This means that AIFMs should report this information if the reporting code 
has changed compared to the previous reporting. Information marked as conditional is linked 
to other information (flags) in the reporting template. If those flags are answered with “Yes”, 
the  corresponding  conditional  information  has  to  be  reported.  However,  if  those  flags  are 
answered  with  “No”,  the  corresponding  conditional  information  should  not  be  reported.  For 
example, if the question 41 (master feeder flag) is answered with “Yes”, AIFMs should indicate 
in field 42 the name of the master AIFs. 
Question 22 [last update 21 July 2014]: How should AIFMs calculate the percentage of trade 
volumes  for  derivatives  cleared  by  a  CCP  and  bilaterally  (questions  152  and  153  of  the 
consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer  22:  AIFMs  should  take  into  account  the  total  number  of  trades  and  report  the 
percentage of number of trades cleared by a CCP and bilaterally. The total should equal 100%. 
Question  23  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  percentage  of 
market value for repo trades cleared by a CCP, bilaterally or on a tri-party basis (questions 154 
and 156 of the consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer  23:  AIFMs  should  aggregate  the  market  value  of  all  repo  trades  and  report  the 
percentage of the market value of repo trades cleared by a CCP, bilaterally or on a tri-party 
basis. The total should equal 100%. 
Question 24 [last update 21 July 2014]: How should AIFMs classify FX spot trades when 
answering questions such as on individual exposures (questions 121 to 124 of the consolidated 
reporting template for AIF-specific information) or value of turnover in each asset class over 
15 
the  reporting  period  (questions  125  to  127  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  for  AIF-
specific information)? 
 
 
 
Answer 24: When reporting information other than value of turnover, AIFMs should classify 
FX spot trades as ‘other cash equivalent (excluding government securities)’ with the sub-asset 
type code ‘SEC_CSH_OTHC’. When reporting information on value of turnover, AIFMs should 
classify  FX  spot 
the  sub-asset  type  code 
‘SEC_CSH_CSH’. 
‘other  cash  equivalent’  with 
trades  as 
Question 25 [last update 21 July 2014]: AIFMs have to report value of turnover in each asset 
class over the reporting period (questions 125 to 127 of the consolidated reporting template 
for AIF-specific information). What information should AIFMs report for these questions when 
no trades took place during the reporting period? 
Answer  25:  AIFMs  should  use  the  field  ‘total  other’  with  the  sub-asset  type  code 
‘OTH_OTH_OTH’ and report ‘0’.  
Question 26 [last update 21 July 2014]: How should AIFMs classify cross-currency interest 
swaps  when  answering  questions  such  as  those  on  individual  exposures  (questions  121  to 
124 of the consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information) or value of turnover in 
each asset class over the reporting period (questions 125 to 127 of the consolidated reporting 
template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer 26: When reporting information other than value of turnover, AIFMs should classify 
cross-currency  interest  swaps  as  ‘interest  rate  derivatives’  with  the  sub-asset  type  code 
‘DER_IRD_INTR’.  When  reporting  information  on  value  of  turnover,  AIFMs  should  classify 
cross-currency  interest  swaps  as  ‘interest  rate  derivatives’  with  the  sub-asset  type  code 
‘DER_IRD_IRD’. 
Question 27 [last update 11 November 2014]: When answering questions 148 and 149 of 
the  consolidated  reporting  template,  should  AIFMs  include  repo  and  reverse  repurchase 
agreements? 
Answer 27: Yes, but AIFMs should only include securities received by the AIFs. 
Question  28  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs managing  AIFs  holding  cash 
report the breakdown of investment strategies? 
Answer 28: When the holding of cash is part of a strategy such as a CTA14 strategy, AIFMs 
should not report cash separately. For example, an AIF with a CTA strategy representing 70% 
of its NAV, out of which 30% of the NAV is made up of cash at the time of the reporting date, 
should allocate 70% of its NAV to the CTA strategy. 
                                                
14 A commodity trading advisor (CTA) generally acts as an asset manager, following a set of investment strategies utilizing futures 
contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of underlying instruments. 
16 
 
 
 
If  the  holding  of  cash  is  not  part  of  an  investment  strategy,  AIFMs  should  use  the  strategy 
‘other’ of the predominant AIF type selected and report the corresponding percentage of the 
NAV held in cash. AIFMs should also use the field ‘description’ to make it clear that the field 
‘other’ is made up of cash. 
Question 29 [last update 21 July 2014]: Question 6 above clarifies that negative values can 
be  reported  for  investment  strategies.  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on  investment 
strategies with negative values? 
Answer 29: AIFMs should allocate the status of predominant AIF type to the strategy with the 
highest absolute percentage of the NAV. The predominant AIF type ‘multi-strategy hedge fund’ 
should be used when no strategy has an absolute value greater than 50% of the NAV. 
Question 30 [last update 21 July 2014]: Should AIFMs consider bank overdrafts as funding 
sources? 
Answer 30: Yes. 
Question  31  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  Pursuant  to  Article  111  of  the  implementing 
Regulation,  leverage  shall  be  considered  to  be  employed  on  a  substantial  basis  when  the 
exposure of an AIF, as calculated according to the commitment method, exceeds three times 
its NAV. How should AIFMs assess this limit?  
Answer 31: AIFs should be considered as employing leverage on a substantial basis if, over 
the reporting period, the average daily calculation of the exposure as calculated according to 
the commitment method exceeds three times the average daily calculation of the NAV. If the 
exposure  is  calculated  less  frequently  than  daily,  AIFs  should  be  considered  as  employing 
leverage on a substantial basis where, at least once during the reporting period, the exposure 
as calculated according to the commitment method exceeds three times its NAV. 
Question  32  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  managing  AIFs  with  multiple 
share classes identify the AIFs? 
Answer 32: AIFMs reporting information for AIFs with multiple share classes should answer 
questions 24 and questions 30 to 40 of the consolidated reporting template.  
For  AIFs  with  only  one  share  class,  AIFMs  should  only  answer  questions  24  to  33  of  the 
consolidated reporting template. 
Question  33  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  In  question  282  of  the  consolidated  reporting 
template, should AIFMs report the percentage of collateral posted to all counterparties that has 
been re-hypothecated as of the last business day of the reporting period or during the reporting 
period? 
Answer 33: AIFMs should report the percentage of the market value of the collateral that has 
been re-hypothecated during the reporting period. This percentage should be the ratio of the 
aggregated market value of the collateral re-hypothecated during the reporting period by all 
17 
 
 
 
counterparties over the aggregated market value of all the collateral posted by AIFMs to all 
counterparties.  
Question  34  [last  update  21  July  2014]:  What  information  should  AIFMs  report  under 
questions 283 to 286 of the consolidated reporting template? 
Answer 34: For questions 283, 284, 285 and 286, AIFMs should aggregate the market value 
of cash and securities borrowed. 
Question 35 [last update 21 July 2014]: In which currency should AIFMs report information 
on the five principal markets and five principal instruments in which they trade (questions 29 
and 32 of the consolidated reporting template for AIFM-specific information)? 
Answer 35: AIFMs should report this information in Euro. 
Question 36 [last update 30 September 2014]: A non-EU AIFM markets its AIFs in the Union 
under Article 42 of the AIFMD. Should the AIFM continue to report to the national competent 
authorities of the Member States in which it markets its AIFs after the marketing period of the 
AIF has ended? 
Answer  36:  For  non-EU  AIFMs  marketing  their  AIFs  in  the  Union  under  Article  42  of  the 
AIFMD,  the  reporting  obligations  to  national  competent  authorities  does  not  depend  on  the 
actual marketing period of the AIF but rather on the existence of investors in the AIF in the 
jurisdiction of the authority concerned. 
Therefore, non-EU AIFMs should continue to report to national competent authorities after the 
marketing  period  has  ended  unless  they  confirm  that  no  investors  in  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
authority concerned are invested in the AIFs. 
Question  37  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  A  non-EU  AIFM  markets  its  AIFs  in  several 
Member States under Article 42 of the AIFMD. Should the AIFM calculate a reporting frequency 
for  each  Member  State  where  it  markets  its  AIFs  or  should  the  AIFM  calculate  a  unique 
reporting frequency for all Member States in which it markets its AIFs? 
Answer 37: According to Article 110 of the implementing Regulation, AIFMs shall take into 
account  all  the  EU  AIFs  they  manage  and  AIFs  they  market  in  the  Union  to  calculate  the 
reporting frequency. The AIFM should therefore calculate a unique reporting frequency taking 
into account all the AIFs it markets in the Union and apply the same reporting frequency to all 
Member States where it markets its AIFs.  
Similarly, the assets under management in questions 33 and 34 of the consolidated reporting 
template for AIFM-specific information should be based on all the AIFs marketed in the Union 
by a non-EU AIFM and not on the AIFs marketed by a non-EU AIFM in a particular Member 
State.  This  means  that  non-EU  AIFMs  should  report  the  same  amount  of  assets  under 
management to all NCAs to which they report under Article 42 of the AIFMD. 
18 
 
 
 
Question 38 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should AIFMs use the NAV when they report 
information under questions 48 and 86 to 93 of the consolidated reporting template for AIF-
specific information? 
Answer 38: No. AIFMs should use the total value of assets under management calculated in 
accordance with Article 2 of the implementing Regulation. In addition, if the national competent 
authorities  to  which  they  report  have  decided  to  apply  ESMA’s  opinion  on  collection  of 
information  under  Article  24(5),  AIFMs  should  also  use  the  total  value  of  assets  under 
management  for  questions  86  to  93  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  for  AIF-specific 
information. 
Question 39 [last update 30 September 2014]: How should AIFMs calculate the value of the 
five  main  instruments  in  which  the  AIF  is  trading (question  76  of the consolidated  reporting 
template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer  39:  AIFMs  should  calculate  the  values  according  to  Article  2  of  the  implementing 
Regulation  and  not  according  to  Article  3  of  the  AIFMD  as  stated  in  Annex  IV  of  the 
implementing Regulation. 
Question 40 [last update 30 September 2014]: According to Article 110 of the implementing 
Regulation, AIFMs shall report to national competent authorities no later than 30 days or 45 
days for fund of funds after the end of the reporting period. What should AIFMs do if the final 
NAV  of  the  AIFs  for  which  they  report  is  not  available  by  this  deadline  or  is  no  longer 
representative? 
Answer 40: In that situation, AIFMs should use estimates of the NAV of the AIFs and send 
updates afterwards if there is a difference between the estimated NAV and the final NAV. 
Question 41 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should the position type (Long or Short) in 
relation to a derivative instrument be determined by reference to the derivative contract or by 
reference to the exposure to the underlying of the derivative instrument (questions 75, 97, 105, 
123, 124, 129 and 130 of consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)?  
Answer  41:  The  position  type  should  be  determined  by  reference  to  the  exposure  to  the 
underlying of the derivative instrument. As a result, a long position on a put option should be 
reported as ‘Short’ whereas a short position on a put option should be reported as ‘Long’. 
Question  42  [last  update  30  September  2014]:  Should  AIFMs  take  into  account  the 
settlement period when they report information on portfolio liquidity (questions 178 to 184 of 
the consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer 42: AIFMs should adopt a conservative approach when they report information on the 
portfolio liquidity. As a consequence, AIFMs should take into account the time delay for having 
the proceeds of the sale available on a cash account if it has as a non-negligible impact on the 
liquidity profile of the AIF. 
19 
 
 
 
Question 43 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should AIFMs include cash accounts when 
reporting information on the total number of open positions (question 218 of the consolidated 
reporting template for AIF specific information)? 
Answer 43: Yes, AIFMs should take into account all cash accounts that exist.  
Question  44  [last  update  30  September  2014]:  What  value  should  AIFMs  use  to  report 
information  on  the  value  of  securities  borrowed  for  short  positions  (question  289  of  the 
consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer 44: AIFMs should use the market value of the securities borrowed. 
Question 45 [last update 30 September 2014]: Should AIFMs report information on turnover 
of financial derivative instruments based on both market values and notional values (questions 
126 and 127 of the consolidated reporting template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer 45: Yes. 
Question 46 [last update 30 September 2014]: How should AIFMs treat bank overdrafts for 
the purpose of information on individual exposures (questions 123 and 124 of the consolidated 
reporting template)? 
Answer  46:  AIFMs  should  treat  bank  overdrafts  as  short  positions  in  ‘Cash  and  Cash 
Equivalent’. 
Question 47 [last update 11 November 2014]: AIFMs shall report the value of collateral and 
other  credit  support  posted  to  all  counterparties  (questions  157  to  159  of  the  consolidated 
reporting  template).  Should  AIFMs  include  collateral  passed  to  a  clearing  member  for 
transmission to a CCP in these questions? 
Answer 47: Yes. 
Question  48  [last  update  11  November  2014]:  How  should  AIFMs  calculate  the  turnover 
expressed  in  notional  value  for  derivative  instruments  (question  127  of  the  consolidated 
reporting template)? 
Answer 48: AIFMs should convert the derivative positions into an equivalent position in the 
underlying  assets  as  prescribed  in  Article  10  and  Annex  II  of  the  implementing  Regulation 
using the value at the date of the trade and not at the reporting date. 
Question 49 [last update 11 November 2014]: In which categories should AIFMs allocate 
sovereign bonds which fall in the categories ‘Non-G10 with 0-1 year/1year+ term to maturity’ 
and also in the categories ‘EU bonds with 0-1 year/1 year + term to maturity’? 
Answer 49: AIFMs should allocate those sovereign bonds to the categories ‘EU bonds with 0-
1 year/1 year + term to maturity’.

Question  50  [last  update  9  January  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on 
subscriptions  and  redemptions  over  the  reporting  period  (questions  255  to  278  of  the 
consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 50: AIFMs should report the value of subscription and redemption orders and not the 
number of subscription and redemption orders. Information should be reported for the month 
of the cash-flows and not for the month of the subscription and redemption orders unless it is 
the same month. 
For  example,  an  AIFM  is  subject  to  quarterly  reporting  obligations  and  investors  can 
subscribe/redeem 4 times per year on the NAVs of 31/03, 30/06, 30/09 and 31/12 of each year. 
The AIFM receives for January 100 redemption orders, for February 200 redemption orders 
and for March 50 redemption orders (350 redemption orders in total over the reporting period 
Q1). Redemption orders are executed in April on the NAV calculated on 31 March. The NAV 
is €100 per share. Therefore, the AIFM will report redemption orders for a total value of €35,000 
(350*100) in April (reporting for Q2).  
Question  51  [last  update  9  January  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on  the 
change in NAV per month (questions 243 to 254 of the consolidated reporting template)?  
Answer  51:  The  change  in  NAV  captures  both  the  change  due  to  subscriptions  and 
redemptions and the change due to investment performance. It is the net effect on the fund’s 
NAV over the given reporting period after all inflows, outflows and performance are taken into 
account. AIFMs should report information on the change in NAV for each month of the reporting 
period. If no official NAV is available for the calculation,  AIFMs should use estimates of the 
NAV. In some cases (e.g. for AIFs investing in illiquid assets), the best estimate may be the 
previous NAV. 
Question  52  [last  update  9  January  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  report  information  on  the 
percentage  of  gross  and  net  investment  returns  per  month  (questions  219  to  242  of  the 
consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 52: AIFMs should report the information for each month of the reporting period. If no 
official NAV is available for the calculation, AIFMs should use estimates of the NAV. In some 
cases (e.g. for AIFs investing in illiquid assets), the best estimate may be the previous NAV. 
Question 53 [last update 9 January 2015]: An AIFM manages both funds and funds of funds. 
When should the AIFM report aggregated information at the level of the AIFM (AIFM file of the 
consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 53: In that case, the AIFM should report aggregated information at the level of the 
AIFM  and  on  funds  of  funds  no  later  than  45  days  after  the  end  of  the  reporting  period. 
Information on AIFs that do not take the form of fund of funds should be reported 1 month after 
the end of the reporting period as required by Article 110 of the implementing Regulation. 
21 
 
 
 
Question 54 [last update 26 March 2015]: How should AIFMs report information on the total 
long  and  short  value  of  exposures  before  currency  hedging  (questions  128  to  130  of  the 
consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 54: AIFMs should report information on long and short value of exposures for all the 
sub-asset  types  of  questions  122  to  124  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template.  The 
information should be provided in the base currency of the AIF. This means that the sum of 
the short and long value of exposures in questions 129 and 130 should equal the sum of the 
questions 122 to 124. 
Question 55 [last update 26 March 2015]: Should non-EU AIFMs marketing their AIFs in the 
Union under Article 42 of the AIFMD report the results of stress tests under Articles 15 and 16 
of the AIFMD (questions 279 and 280 of the consolidated reporting template)?  
Answer 55: Non-EU AIFMs marketing their AIFs in the Union under Article 42 of the AIFMD 
should  report  the  results  of  stress  tests  insofar  as  this  is  required  by  the  national  private 
placement regime of the Member States where they market their AIFs or if the non-EU AIFMs 
have carried out such stress tests. 
Question 56 [last update 12 May 2015]: How do the reporting obligations apply to AIFMs that 
are sister companies and that are owned by another AIFM? 
Answer 56: The reporting obligations apply to each individual AIFM for the AIFs they manage 
and/or  market  in  the  Union.  This  means  that  each  AIFM  should  report  individually  to  the 
competent authorities of their home Member State according to their own reporting frequency 
as calculated pursuant to Article 110 of the implementing Regulation.  
Question  57  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  consider  commitments  or  actual 
capital drawdowns when they report information on subscriptions over the reporting period for 
AIFs  pursuing  private  equity  strategies  (questions  255  to  266  of  the  consolidated  reporting 
template)? 
Answer 57: AIFMs should consider actual capital drawdowns and not commitments when they 
report information on subscriptions for AIFs pursuing private equity strategies.  
Question 58 [last update 12 May 2015]: What are the reporting obligations for a registered 
AIFM that decides to opt in under the Directive? 
Answer 58: Once a registered AIFM has opted in under the Directive it has to comply with the 
Directive  in  its  entirety.  Therefore,  an  AIFM  that  has  opted  in  has  to  report  to  its  national 
competent authorities the information listed in Article 24 of the Directive. However, the fact that 
the  AIFM  has  opted  into  the  Directive  does  not  impact the  reporting frequency.  Indeed,  the 
AIFM should continue to report on an annual basis to its national competent authorities.  
However, if at a later stage the total value of assets under management of the AIFM that has 
opted in exceeds the thresholds of Article 110 of the implementing Regulation, the AIFM will 
have to report on a more frequent basis to its national competent authorities. 
22 
 
 
 
In certain Member States, all AIFMs have to be authorised under the Directive. Therefore, in 
these  jurisdictions,  AIFMs  whose  total  value  of  assets  under  management  is  under  the 
thresholds of Article 3(2)(a) and (b) of the Directive have to report to their national competent 
authorities the information listed in Article 24 of the Directive. 
Question 59 [last update 12 May 2015]: What information should a non-EU AIFM whose total 
value of assets under management does not exceed the thresholds of Article 3(2)(a) and (b) 
of  the  Directive  and  that  markets  its  AIFs  in  the  Union  under  a  national  private  placement 
regime report to the competent authorities?  
Answer 59: Article 3 of the AIFMD does not make any distinction between EU AIFMs and non-
EU AIFMs. Therefore, non-EU AIFMs whose total value of assets under management does 
not  exceed  the thresholds  of Article  3(2)(a)  and  (b)  and  that market  their  AIFs  in  the  Union 
under a national private placement regime should at least report to the competent authorities 
where they market their AIFs the information listed in Article 3(3)(d) of the Directive. Indeed, 
the national private placement regimes of the Member States where the non-EU AIFM markets 
its AIFs may require non-EU AIFMs to report additional information. 
Question  60  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  What  information  should  an  AIFM  report  for 
questions 128 to 130 of the consolidated reporting template when an AIF invests exclusively 
in assets denominated in the base currency of the AIF? 
Answer 60: The AIFM should report the long and short positions in the base currency of the 
AIF. 
Question 61 [last update 12 May 2015]: Should AIFMs consider distribution of dividends to 
investors as redemptions for the purpose of questions 267 to 278 of the consolidated reporting 
template? 
Answer 61: No. 
Question  62  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  always  apply  the  same  reporting 
frequency to AIFs that are sub-funds of the same umbrella AIFs? 
Answer 62: No. The reporting frequency of an AIF is not affected by the legal structure of the 
AIF. Each AIF, being sub-funds of the same umbrella AIFs or not, has to be treated separately 
for the purpose of the reporting obligations (including for the reporting frequency).  
Question  63  [last  update  12  May  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  take  into  account  cash  and  cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the main instruments in which the AIF is trading (questions 64 
to 77 of the consolidated reporting template), the principal exposures of the AIF (questions 94 
to  102  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template)  and  the  five  most  important  portfolio 
concentrations (questions 103 to 112 of the consolidated reporting template)? 
Answer 63: Yes. 
23 
 
 
 
Question 64 [last update 12 May 2015]: What should be the procedure for the first reporting 
on AIFs? 
Answer 64: The procedure should be the same procedure as for the first reporting on AIFMs. 
This procedure is detailed in paragraphs 11 to 13 of ESMA’s guidelines on reporting obligations 
under Articles 3(3)(d) and 24 (1), (2) and (4) of the AIFMD. 
Question 65 [last update July  2017]: How should AIFMs convert the total value of assets 
under management into Euro? 
Answer 65: First of all, AIFMs should use the rounded values of the AIFs in the base currency 
of the AIFs. Then, AIFMs should divide these rounded values by the corresponding rate of one 
unit of the base currency in Euros. For example, if the base currency of an AIF, reporting for 
31 March 2015, is the US dollar and is using the ECB rate, AIFMs should multiply the rounded 
value in US dollar of the AIF by 0.9312, which was the spot rate on that date.  
AIFMs should report the rounded values in Euro and in the base currency in questions 33 and 
34 of the consolidated reporting template for AIFM-specific information and in question 48 in 
Euro  of  the  consolidated  reporting  template  for  AIF-specific  information.  AIFMs  should  also 
report the value of the exchange rate used for the conversion in question 37 of the consolidated 
reporting  template  for  AIFM-specific  information  and  in  question  50  of  the  consolidated 
reporting template for AIF-specific information. 
Question 66 [last update 21 July 2015]: Question 64 above clarifies that the procedure for 
first reporting of AIFs should be the same procedure as for first reporting of AIFMs as laid down 
in ESMA’s guidelines on reporting obligations. This means that AIFMs should not report any 
information  on  AIFs  for  the  reporting  period  during  which  the  AIFs  were  created.  However, 
should AIFMs include AIFs created during the reporting period in the total value of assets under 
management of the AIFM for that reporting period? 
Answer 66: Yes. This means that the total value of assets under management at the level of 
the AIFM at the reporting date (question 33 of the consolidated reporting template for AIFM-
specific information) will not be the sum of the values of assets under management of the AIFs 
reported for that reporting period. 
Question 67 [last update 02 December 2015]: According to questions 54 to 56 and 210 to 
217  of the  consolidated reporting template,  AIFMs  have  to report on the jurisdictions  of the 
three main funding sources (excluding units or shares of the AIF bought by investors) as well 
as on the aggregate amount of borrowing and cash financing. Should AIFMs include all liquidity 
that is made available to the AIF (including the cash received in the context of securities lending 
transactions  and  repurchase  transactions),  unless  it  originates  from  the  payment  of 
subscriptions related to units or shares of the AIF bought by investors? 
Answer 67: Yes. 
Question  68  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  According  to  questions  121  to  124  of  the 
reporting  template  for  AIF-specific  information,  AIFMs  have  to  categorise  loans  as  either 
24 
 
 
 
leveraged or other loans. ESMA guidelines provide that where a loan is syndicated the loan 
should be classified as ‘other’. How should a leveraged syndicated loan be classified for the 
purpose of completion of these questions? 
Answer  68:  To  ensure  consistency  of  reporting  all  leveraged  loans,  whether  syndicated  or 
otherwise, should be disclosed as leveraged loans. 
Question 69 [last update 02 December 2015]: According to question 285 of the reporting 
template for AIF-specific information, AIFMs shall report information on collateralised/secured 
cash borrowing – via (reverse) repo. Should AIFMs report cash from repurchase agreements 
as cash borrowings? 
Answer 69: Yes. 
Question 70 [last update 02 December 2015]: Question 66 clarifies that newly created AIFs 
should  be  included  in  the  total  AUM  of  the  AIFM  at  the  reporting  date  (question  33  of  the 
reporting template for AIFM-specific information). Should information on newly created AIFs 
also be included in questions 26 to 32 of the reporting template for AIF-specific information? 
Answer 70: No. Information on the newly created AIF(s) should only be included in the total 
AUM  of  the  AIFM  as  reported  at  question  33  of  the  reporting  template  for  AIFM-specific 
information. 
Question 71 [last update 02 December 2015]: According to Article 2(4) of the implementing 
Regulation, AIFMs may exclude investments of AIFs in other AIFs they manage for the purpose 
of  calculating  the  total  value  of  assets  under  management.  Does  ESMA  expect  AIFMs  to 
exclude such investments from the calculation of the total value of assets under management? 
Answer  71:  Yes.  In  order  to  ensure  the  comparability  of  the  results  at  an  EU  level,  it  is 
important  that  AIFMs  calculate  their  total  value  of  assets  under  management  in  the  same 
manner. In situations where feeder AIFs invest in master AIFs and where these are managed 
by  the  same  AIFM,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  duplication  of  assets  under 
management. 
Question  72  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  When  reporting  information  on  their 
investment strategies, should AIFMs report the investment strategy that corresponds to their 
portfolio of assets as at the reporting date or should they indicate the investment strategy that 
is disclosed to investors in the fund rules or other offering documents?  
Answer 72: AIFMs should report the investment strategy that is disclosed to investors in the 
fund rules or other offering documents. 
Question  73  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  How  should  AIFMs  determine  the 
geographical focus of assets in which they invest such as stocks, bonds or financial derivatives 
(questions 78 to 85 of the consolidated template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer 73: AIFMs should take into account the domicile of the company/entity to which the 
AIFs have an exposure. For example, if an AIF invests in a stock of a company domiciled in 
25 
 
 
 
Europe but traded in the US, the corresponding geographical area would be Europe and not 
North-America. Similarly, an AIF that invest in a bond issued in the US market by a company 
domiciled  in  the  Europe  should  select  Europe.  For  financial  derivative  instruments  such  as 
options,  AIFMs  should  look  at  the  financial  instrument  underlying  the  financial  derivative 
instruments and apply the same approach as for stocks and bonds.  
Question 74 [last update 02 December 2015]: Is information on gross and net investment 
returns, change in NAV, subscriptions and redemptions mandatory or optional? 
Answer  74:  This  information  is  mandatory  for  Article  24(2)  AIF  reporting  contents  but,  to 
enable  the  necessary  functional  flexibility,  it  is  classified  as  optional  from  a  technical 
standpoint. This information is optional from a technical standpoint because AIFMs only have 
to report this information for the months corresponding to the reporting period for which they 
report. For example, an AIFM that reports on quarterly basis will report in Q2 only information 
for  April,  May  and  June  and  not for  January,  February  and  March.  Information  on  January, 
February and March would have been part of the report for Q1.  
Question  75  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  When  reporting  information  on  leverage, 
should AIFMs report a ratio or a percentage? 
Answer 75: AIFMs should report a percentage. 
Question 76 [last update 02 December 2015]: When reporting the investment strategy of a 
feeder AIF, should AIFMs look through the master AIF? 
Answer 76: ESMA expects that in most instances, feeder AIFs will have the same investment 
strategy  as  the  master AIF  unless  the  investments  made by  the feeder AIF  in  other  assets 
make the resulting strategy different. 
Question  77  [last  update  02  December  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  include  master/feeder 
structures when answering questions 290 to 293 of the consolidated template for AIF-specific 
information? 
 Answer 77: No. 
Question 78 [last update 02 December 2015]: Is information on liquidity profile mandatory 
or optional (questions 178 to 192 of the reporting template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer 78: This information is mandatory.  
Question 79 [last update 02 December 2015]: What information should AIFMs communicate 
when they report a total value of assets under management with a value of 0 at the AIFM level 
(question  33  of  the  reporting  template  for  AIFM-specific  information)  or  at  the  AIF  level 
(question 48 of the reporting template for AIF-specific information)? 
Answer 79: AIFMs should use the assumption boxes of the reporting template to explain why 
the total value of assets under management equals 0. For example, this may be because the 
26 
 
 
 
assets of the AIF have been liquidated, merged with or transferred to another AIF or because 
the management of the AIF has been transferred to another AIFM. 
Question 80 [last update May 2017]: How should AIFMs report information on the breakdown 
between retail and professional investors (questions 119 and 120 of the reporting template for 
AIF-specific information) when this information is not available? 
Answer: When the information is not available, AIFMs should report ‘0’ for questions 119 and 
120 and use the assumption boxes to indicate that the information is not available.  
Question 81 [last update July 2017]:  In a situation where an AIF purchases a loan in the 
secondary market, how should the AIF measure its exposure in relation to that loan? 
Answer:  In  this  case  the  notional  value  of  the  loan  may  overestimate  the  risk  exposure. 
Therefore, the AIF should report the valuation of the loan, as it is reported in the calculation of 
its  NAV.  For  example,  if  an  AIF  purchases  a  distressed  and  unlevered  loan  for  €10  cash 
(without the use of leverage) and the notional amount of that loan (i.e. the outstanding principal) 
was €100, the AIF should report the amount it actually spent to acquire the loan i.e. €10, which 
corresponds to the maximum  potential  loss  on the  loan  transaction,  not the  AIF’s  exposure 
with respect to that loan which would be €100 (i.e., the notional amount of such loan). During 
the life of the loan, the AIF should then measure the exposure in relation to that loan using the 
same valuation rules as the ones used for the calculation of its NAV.    
Question 82 [last update July 2017]: In which currency should the NAV of the AIF (question 
53 of the consolidated reporting template) be reported? 
Answer: AIFMs should report the NAV in the base currency of the AIF.

Section IV: Notification of AIFMs 
Date last updated: 4 October 2018 
Question 1 [last update 27 June 2014]: May an AIFM manage an AIF in a host MS under 
Article 33 of the AIFMD without having identified any existing AIF in that host MS beforehand? 
Answer  1  [last  update  27  June  2014]:  Yes.  The  fact  that  an  AIFM  cannot  identify  a  pre-
existing AIF in the host MS does not prevent an AIFM from managing an AIF in that host MS 
under Article 33 of the AIFMD. In practice, the creation of the first AIF in the host MS is usually 
conditional on the AIFM having previously notified the host MS’s national competent authority 
under Article 33 of the AIFMD. Therefore, it may be necessary for an AIFM to first notify its 
wish to make use of the management passport under Article 33 in order to subsequently be in 
a position to create and manage AIFs in that host MS. 
Question 2 [last update 27 June 2014]: When an AIFM wishes to manage an AIF in a host 
MS for the first time, but has not yet set up any AIF in that host MS, how should it comply with 
the requirement of Article 33(2)(b) of the AIFMD to identify the AIFs it intends to manage? 
Answer 2 [last update 27 June 2014]: If the AIFM has no prior presence in the host MS it is 
sufficient for the AIFM to specify the types of strategy of the AIFs it intends to manage in the 
host MS. However, this is without prejudice to the obligation for the AIFM to communicate a 
programme of operations stating the services it intends to perform in the host MS.  
Question 3 [last update 26 March 2015]: Should an AIFM that is already managing AIFs in 
a host Member State under Article 33 of the AIFMD and that wishes to manage a new AIF in 
that host Member State undertake a new notification under Article 33(2) of the AIFMD? 
Answer 3: The AIFM should not undertake a new notification under Article 33(2) of the AIFMD 
every time it wishes to manage a new AIF established in a given Member State. The original 
Article 33(2) notification should be considered valid for all the AIFs it intends to manage in that 
given Member State. In such cases, an update in accordance with Article 33(6) should be sent 
to identify each new AIF to be managed under the original Article 33(2) notification. When the 
proposed new AIFs are of a different type from the ones specified in the original Article 33(2) 
notification, the AIFM should clarify this in the update submitted under Article 33(6). 
Question 4 [last update June 2017]: An AIFM wants to manage AIFs domiciled in another 
Member  State  by  way  of  the  AIF  management  passport  (Article  33  of  AIFMD).  In  the 
programme  of  operations,  how  does  the  AIFM  have  to  provide  information  on  the  AIFs  it 
intends to manage? 
Answer: Where specific AIFs cannot be identified at the time of the notification, the AIFs to be 
managed may be identified by their investment strategy. In that regard, ESMA sees merit in 
relying  on  the  investment  strategies  contained  in  the  reporting  template  for  identification 
purposes (Annex IV of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 231/2013). Where an AIFM 
28 
 
 
 
has only been authorised to manage certain types of AIFs, it could also refer to the scope of 
its authorisation to identify the funds to be managed. 
Where the AIFM is able to identify specific AIFs, these should be identified in the programme 
of  operations  by  their  name  and  national  identifier (if  available). Information  on those funds 
should also include their investment strategies. 
In accordance with Article 33(6) of AIFMD, all changes to the programme of operations have 
to be notified by the AIFM to the competent authorities in its home Member State. This includes 
changes to the programme of operations in cases where the AIFM intends to manage further 
AIFs (if specified by name) or types of AIFs (if specified by investment strategy) not previously 
listed in that document. 
*** NEW *** Question 5 [last update 4 October 2018]: An AIFM intends to manage an EU 
umbrella AIF on a cross-border basis by way of the AIF management passport (Article 33 of 
AIFMD).  Does  the  AIFM  have  to  identify  all  the  compartments  of  the  umbrella  AIF  in  the 
notification? 
Answer 5 [last update 4 October 2018]: Yes. In the notification, the AIFM has to identify the 
umbrella AIF, as well as the name and investment strategy of its compartments, to facilitate 
administrative procedure in home and host Member States. 
Any change in the composition of an umbrella AIF that is managed on a cross-border basis 
has to be notified to the competent authorities pursuant to Article 33(6) of AIFMD.

Section V: MiFID services under Article 6(4) of the AIFMD 
Date last updated: 27 June 2014 
Question 1 [last update 27 June 2014]: Can competent authorities in a Member State other 
than the home Member State of an AIFM accept passport notifications for the activities of the 
AIFM authorised under Article 6(4) of the AIFMD?  
Answer 1: Yes. Article 92 of Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID 2) modifies the provisions of the 
AIFMD in order to establish that an AIFM authorised to provide the MiFID investment services 
mentioned under Article 6(4) of the AIFMD has the right to provide these services on a cross-
border basis under the authorisation granted by the competent authorities of its home Member 
State.  
Member States must apply the measures referred to in Article 92 of MiFID 2 from 3 July 2015. 
However, the principle of sincere cooperation set out in Article 4(3) TFEU requires the Member 
States to facilitate the achievement of the Union’s tasks and refrain from any measure which 
could  jeopardise the  attainment  of  the  Union’s  objectives.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that 
competent  authorities  accept  passport  notifications  for  the  activities  of  the  AIFM  authorised 
under Article 6(4) of the AIFMD even before 3 July 2015.

Section VI: Depositaries 
Date last updated: 16 December 2015 
Question 1 [last update 21 July 2014]: Do the cash monitoring duties apply on a look-through 
basis to cash accounts which are not opened in the name of the AIF/AIFM, but in the name of 
financial and/ or legal structures established by the AIF or by the AIFM acting on behalf of the 
AIF for the purposes of investing in the underlying assets and which are controlled directly or 
indirectly by the AIF or by the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF? 
Answer  1:  No,  the  cash  monitoring  requirements  under  Articles  85  and  86  of  Commission 
Regulation (EU) No 231/2013 (the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation) do not apply to cash accounts 
opened in the name of companies in which the AIF/AIFM holds investments.  
Question 2 [last update 21 July 2014]: Is it possible for the depositary to delegate to a third 
party  (e.g.  an  administrator  which  is  not  an  affiliate  of  the  depositary)  the  cash  flow 
reconciliation duties? 
Answer 2: No. According to the provisions of Article 21(11) of the AIFMD, the monitoring of 
the cash flow is an activity which cannot be delegated. For example, the depositary should not 
rely  exclusively  on  the  reconciliation  processes  performed  by  a  third  party,  even  where  the 
depositary performs due diligence on those processes.  
In line with the provisions of recital 42 of the AIFMD, the only delegation which is permitted in 
relation to the monitoring of the cash flow is that of the depositary’s supporting tasks, such as 
administrative  or  technical functions  performed  by  the  depositary  as  a  part  of  its  depositary 
tasks.  
Question 3 [last update 21 July 2014]: How far down the distribution chain is the depositary 
to reconcile subscription flows?  
Answer 3: The cash monitoring duties relate to any of the cash accounts – including accounts 
used  for  subscriptions  and  redemptions  –  referred  to  in  Article  21(7)  of  the  AIFMD  (as 
implemented by Articles 85 to 87 of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation): accounts opened in the 
name of the AIF, in the name of the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF or in the name of the 
depositary acting on behalf of the AIF. The rules on reconciliations linked to subscriptions are 
further detailed in Article 93 of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation.  
Question 4 [last update 21 July 2014]: Does the obligation to verify that the AIF and AIFM 
comply with applicable laws and regulations in Article 95 (a) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation 
cover anti-money laundering rules, labour law and contracts of the AIF/AIFM with third parties 
which do not relate to the asset or risk management activities? 
Answer 4: In general, the obligation to set up and implement appropriate procedures for the 
verifications required under Article 95(a) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation should be linked to 
the requirement in Article 21(9) of the AIFMD for the depositary to ensure oversight of the AIF’s 
31 
 
 
 
operations. The verifications required under Article 95(a) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation are 
meant  to  ensure  that  the  AIF  and/or  the  AIFM  acting  on  behalf  of  the  AIF  comply  with  the 
applicable  laws  and  regulations  applying  to  the  AIF  including  fund  rules,  instruments  of 
incorporation (e.g. investment restrictions, leverage limits, etc.). They do not relate to the laws 
and  regulations  applying  to  these  entities  that  do  not  have  any  direct  relation  with  the 
instructions of the AIFM to the depositary (e.g. the application of the remuneration rules by the 
AIFM).  This  is  without  prejudice  to  the  depositary  voluntarily  (or  in  agreement  with  the 
AIF/AIFM) performing more extensive verifications. 
Therefore,  the  obligation  to  verify  that  the  AIF  and  AIFM  comply  with  applicable  laws  and 
regulations does not cover labour law or contracts with third parties unrelated to asset or risk 
management activities.  
As for the compliance with the relevant anti-money laundering rules, the contract by which the 
depositary is appointed shall include information on the tasks and responsibilities of the parties 
to the contract in respect of obligations relating to the prevention of money laundering and the 
financing  of  terrorism  (Article  83(1)(m))  of  the  AIFMD  Level  2  Regulation.  This  is  without 
prejudice to the relevant anti-money laundering obligations applying to the depositary, AIF and 
AIFM  under  the  EU  legislation  on  the  prevention  of  the  use  of  the  financial  system  for  the 
purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. 
Question 5 [last update 21 July 2014]: Is it correct to say that where derivative contracts 
contain  a  netting  clause,  derivatives  should  fall  exclusively  under  the  cash  flow  monitoring 
obligation of the depositary and that it is only in the absence of a netting clause – where the 
AIF/AIFM gets an ownership claim for the underlying – that the depositary is in a position to 
verify  whether  the  AIF/AIFM  has  acquired  ownership  of  the  underlying  asset  according  to 
Article 90(2)(c) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013? 
Answer 5: No. Recital 103 of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation gives examples of assets that are 
not  financial  instruments  to  be  held  in  custody  and  specifically  includes  'financial  contracts 
such  as  derivatives'  among  these  examples.  Therefore,  these  assets  are  subject  to  the 
obligation to verify the ownership and maintain a record according to the provisions of Article 
90(2)(c) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation. This duty involves, inter alia, looking at the contract 
to assess what the AIF/AIFM is entitled to.  
Question 6 [last update 21 July 2014]: Are holdings in collective investment undertakings to 
be held in custody or subject to record keeping? 
Answer 6: Unless, in accordance with applicable national law, they are only directly registered 
with the issuer itself or its agent, in the name of the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF 
(in which case the provisions of Article 88(2) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation apply), units of 
collective investment undertakings (CIUs) should be held in custody and subject to the relevant 
provisions of the AIFMD.  
32 
 
 
 
Question 7 [last update 21 July 2014]: Within the cash monitoring duties of a depositary, 
what is the meaning of “close of business day”? 
Answer 7: Given that the requirements relating to the monitoring of the AIF's cash flows apply 
to  the  depositary  (Article  86  of  the  AIFMD  Level  2  Regulation), the "close  of  business  day" 
should be determined in relation to the jurisdiction where the depositary is established which, 
for EU AIFs, is also the home Member State of the AIF. This means that the identification of 
significant cash flows referred to under Article 86(c) of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation should 
be made with reference to the close of business day in the jurisdiction where the depositary is 
established,  but  the  relevant  checks  may  be  carried  out  after  the  close  of  business  in  the 
depositary’s jurisdiction, typically the following business day. 
Question  8  [last  update  1  October  2015]: When  assets  of  an  AIF  held  in  custody  by  the 
depositary  of  the  AIF  are  provided  by  that  depositary  to  a  CSD  or  a  third  country  CSD  as 
defined  under  Regulation  (EU)  No  909/2014  (CSDR)  in  order  to  be  held  in  custody  in 
accordance with Article 21(8) of the AIFMD, does the CSD or third country CSD have to comply 
with the provisions on delegation set out under Article 21(11) of the AIFMD? 
Answer 8: Yes.  
Question 9 [last update 16 December 2015]: Does the depositary’s liability regime apply to 
those assets for which a depositary has safe-keeping duties on a look-through basis according 
to  Articles  89(3),  first  sub-paragraph,  and  90(5),  first  sub-paragraph  of  the  AIFMD  Level  2 
Regulation? 
Answer 9: Yes. The look-through requirements under Articles 89(3), first sub-paragraph, and 
90(5), first sub-paragraph of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation mean that the depositary has safe-
keeping duties in relation to the relevant assets. The safe-keeping duties are described under 
Article 21(8) of the AIFMD and the depositary’s liability regime set out under Article 21(12) of 
the AIFMD (and the relevant implementing provisions under the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation) 
apply  to  safekeeping  activities.  This  means  that  for  financial  instruments  held  in  custody  to 
which  the  look-through  requirements  under  Article  89(3),  first  sub-paragraph  of  the  AIFMD 
Level  2  Regulation  apply,  the  depositary  is subject  to  the  strict  liability  regime  under  Article 
21(12),  second  sub-paragraph  of  the  AIFMD.  For  other  assets  to  which  the  look-through 
requirements under Article 90(5), first sub-paragraph of the AIFMD Level 2 Regulation apply, 
the depositary is subject to the liability regime under Article 21(12), third sub-paragraph of the 
AIFMD. 
According to Articles 89(3), second sub-paragraph, and 90(5), second sub-paragraph of the 
AIFMD  Level  2  Regulation,  the  look-through  provision  does  not  apply  to  funds  of  funds  or 
master-feeder structures provided they have a depositary which safe-keeps the fund’s assets 
appropriately. Therefore, it is only for this type of investment that the liability regime should not 
apply to the depositary of the AIF as a consequence of the fact that the depositary is not subject 
to any safe-keeping duties in relation to those investments.

Section VII: Calculation of leverage 
Date last updated: 12 May 2015 
Question 1 [last update 21 July 2014]: An AIF that is a private equity fund as referred to in 
recital  78  of  the  AIFMD,  controls  a  financial  structure  that  is  used  to  acquire  non-listed 
companies or issuers. The financial structure raises debt to finance the acquisition of those 
assets. When calculating the exposure of the AIF, shall the AIFM include the debt raised at the 
level of the financial structure? 
Answer  1:  According  to  Article  6(3)  of  Regulation  231/2013,  exposure  contained  in  any 
financial  or  legal  structures  controlled  by  an  AIF  shall  be  included  in  the  calculation  of  the 
exposure  where those  structures  are  specifically  set  up  to  directly  or  indirectly  increase the 
exposure at the level of the AIF. Therefore, debt raised by such a financial structure to finance 
the  acquisition  of  assets  shall  be  included  in  the  calculation  of  the  exposure  where  those 
structures are: (1) specifically set up to directly or indirectly increase the exposure at the level 
of the AIF and (2) the AIF controls such a structure. If these two conditions are fulfilled, the 
debt raised by the financial structure is to be included in the calculation of the exposure of the 
AIF.  
Where the AIF does not have to bear losses beyond its investment in a financial structure that 
is  used  to  acquire  non-listed  companies  or  issuers,  the  financial  structure  should  not  be 
considered as having been set up to directly or indirectly increase the exposure at the level of 
the  AIF.  In  any  case,  these  structures  should  not  be  used  as  a  means  to  circumvent  the 
provisions of the AIFMD on leverage.  
Question 2 [last update 21 July 2014]: An AIF controls a financial structure that is used to 
acquire non-listed companies or issuers. When calculating the exposure of the AIF, shall the 
AIFM include the debt raised at the level of the non-listed companies or issuers? 
Answer  2:  No,  provided  that  the  AIF  does  not  have  to  bear  potential  losses  beyond  its 
investment in the non-listed companies or issuers.  
However,  if  the  debt  at  the  level  of  the non-listed  companies  or  issuers exposes  the  AIF to 
potential losses beyond its investment in those non-listed companies or issuers, the debt shall 
be included in the calculation of the exposure of the AIF.  
Question 3 [last update 21 July 2014]: An AIF controls a financial structure that acquires 
non-listed companies or issuers by raising debt. At the time of the acquisition, the non-listed 
companies or issuers were not leveraged. Subsequently, the non-listed companies or issuers 
raise debt to finance a dividend distribution enabling the financial structure to reimburse entirely 
its acquisition debt. When calculating the exposure of the AIF, shall the AIFM include the debt 
raised at the level of the non-listed companies or issuers? 
Answer  3:  No,  provided  that  the  AIF  does  not  have  to  bear  potential  losses  beyond  its 
investment in the non-listed companies or issuers.  
34 
 
 
 
Question  4  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  When  calculating  the  exposure  of  an  AIF  in 
accordance with the gross method under Article 7(a) of the implementing Regulation, should 
AIFMs exclude the value of all cash held in the base currency of the AIF?  
Answer 4: Yes. The exclusion of cash held in the base currency of the AIF applies to cash 
and also to cash equivalents that meet the requirements of Article 7(a) of the implementing 
Regulation. 
Question 5 [last update 12 May 2015]: Which positions should AIFMs take into account when 
calculating  their  exposure  under  the  commitment  approach  pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the 
Implementing Regulation? 
Answer: AIFMs should take into account the absolutes value of all the positions of their AIFs 
valued in accordance with Article 19 of the AIFMD and the criteria laid down in paragraphs 2 
to 9 of Article 8 of the Implementing Regulation. For derivative instruments, as required under 
Article 8(2)(a), AIFMs should convert each position into an equivalent position in the underlying 
assets  using  the  methodologies  set  out  in  Article  10  (which  refers  to  Annex  II  of  the 
implementing  Regulation)  and  points  (4)  to  (9)  and  (14)  in  Annex  I  of  the  implementing 
Regulation.

Section VIII: Delegation 
Date last updated: 16 November 2016 
Question  1  [last  update  30  September  2014]:  An  AIFM  manages  multiple  AIFs.  When 
assessing  whether  any delegation  of  portfolio  management  and/or  risk management  by  the 
AIFM results in the AIFM becoming a letter-box entity as referred to in Article 20 of the AIFMD, 
should the assessment be made at the level of the AIFM or at the level of each AIF? 
Answer 1: The provisions on letter-box entities in Article 82 of the implementing Regulation 
apply in relation to the management of a particular AIF and not in relation to a group of AIFs. 
The assessment should therefore be carried out at the level of each individual AIF. 
Question 2 [last update 16 November 2016]: Where the AIFM does not itself perform the 
functions set out in Annex I of the AIFMD, does this release the AIFM from its responsibility to 
ensure compliance of the relevant function(s) with the AIFMD? 
Answer 2: No. Where a third party performs a function stated in Annex I of the AIFMD, this 
function  should  be  considered  as  having  been  delegated  by  the  AIFM  to  the  third  party. 
Therefore, the AIFM should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements on 
delegation set out in Article 20 of the AIFMD and the principle expressed in Article 5(1) of the 
Directive according to which the single AIFM appointed for an AIF is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with the AIFMD. For the avoidance of doubt, this applies to all functions stated in 
point 1 and point 2 of Annex I of the AIFMD. 
Question 3 [last update 16 November 2016]: Can an externally-managed AIF itself perform 
the investment management functions set out in point 1 of Annex I or functions set out in point 
2  of  Annex  I  of  the  AIFMD  or  would  it  be  possible  that  the  external  AIFM  delegates  the 
performance  of  these  functions  to  the  governing  body  or  any  other  internal  resource  of  the 
externally-managed AIF? 
Answer 3: No. Externally-managed AIFs are not regulated as AIFM. The performance of the 
functions  stated  in  Annex  I  of  the  AIFMD  is  only  permitted  for  AIFs  which  are  internally-
managed pursuant to Article 5(1)(b) of the AIFMD. Where the AIF appoints an external AIFM 
pursuant to Article 5(1)(a), the external AIFM is through its appointment as AIFM of the AIF 
responsible for providing the functions stated in Annex I of the AIFMD. The external AIFM may 
delegate  to  third  parties  the  task  of  carrying  out  functions  on  its  behalf  in  accordance  with 
Article 20 of the AIFMD. The AIF is, however, not a ‘third party’ in accordance with Article 20(1) 
of the AIFMD.

Section IX: Calculation of the total value of assets under management 
Date last updated: 3 June 2016 
Question  1  [last  update  11  November  2014]:  Should  AIFMs  include  short  derivative 
positions in the calculation of the total value of assets under management? 
Answer  1:  Yes.  According  to  Article  2(3)  of  the  implementing  Regulation,  AIFMs  should 
convert derivative instrument positions (both long and short) into an equivalent position in the 
underlying assets and the absolute value of that equivalent position should then be used for 
the calculation of the total value of assets under management. 
Question 2 [last update 21 July 2015]: Should AIFMs include short non-derivative positions 
for the calculation of the total value of assets under management? 
Answer  2:  Yes.  According  to  Article  2(1)(b)  of  the  implementing  Regulation,  AIFMs  should 
include  assets  acquired  through  leverage.  Where  a  short  sale  occurs  with  assets  being 
received,  AIFMs  should  include  the  assets  received  in  the  calculation  of  the  total  value  of 
assets under management. 
Question  3  [last  update  3  June  2016]:  Should  “committed  capital”  be  taken  into  account 
when calculating the total value of assets under management (AuM) pursuant to Article 3(2) 
of AIFMD and Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013? 
Answer 3: Generally, no. As a general rule, committed capital does not contribute to the actual 
assets of the AIF for which it was pledged, as long as it has not been drawn down by the AIFM. 
However, Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013 makes reference to national 
valuation  rules  as  well  as  to  rules  on  valuation  contained  in  the  AIF  rules  or  articles  of 
incorporation. Committed capital should therefore be taken into account in the calculation of 
total AUM if national rules foresee this.

Section X: Additional own funds 
Date last updated: 3 June 2016 
Question  1:  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  exclude  investments  by  AIFs  in 
other AIFs they manage for the calculation of additional own funds under Article 9(3) of the 
AIFMD? 
Answer 1: Yes. 
Question  2:  [last  update  26  March  2015]:  Should  AIFMs  exclude  investments  by  AIFs  in 
other AIFs they manage for the calculation of additional own funds to cover potential liability 
risks arising from professional negligence under Article 9(7) of the AIFMD? 
Answer 2: No, because investments in other AIFs managed by the same AIFM increase the 
operational risk. 
Question  3  [last  update  3  June  2016]:  Should  “committed  capital”  be  taken  into  account 
when calculating the additional own funds requirement pursuant to Articles 9(3) and 9(7) of 
AIFMD and Article 14(2) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2013? 
Answer 3: As a general rule, committed capital does not contribute to the actual assets of the 
AIF for which it was pledged, as long as it has not been drawn down by the AIFM. 
 
 
38 
 
 
 
Section XI: Scope 
Date last updated: 26 March 2015 
Question 1 [last update 26 March 2015]: According to Article 36(1) of the AIFMD, Member 
States may allow an authorised EU AIFM to market to professional investors, in their territory 
only, units or shares of EU feeder AIFs which have a non-EU master AIF managed by a non-
EU AIFM provided that the EU AIFM managing the EU feeder AIF fulfils certain conditions as 
set out in Article 36(1) (a) to (c). Does the non-EU AIFM managing the non-EU master AIF also 
have to be authorised under the AIFMD? 
Answer 1: According to Article 36(2) of the AIFMD, Member States may impose stricter rules 
on the AIFM in respect of the application of Article 36 of the AIFMD. Therefore, whether the 
non-EU  AIFM  managing  the  non-EU  master  AIFs  has  to  be  authorised  under  the  AIFMD 
depends on the national law of the Member State transposing Article 36 of the AIFMD.

Section XII: Impact of Regulation (EU) 648/2012 (EMIR)15 on AIFMD 
Date last updated: 24 May 2017 
Question  1  [last  update  19  July  2016]:  For  OTC financial  derivative  transactions  that  are 
centrally  cleared  and  subject  to  the  reporting  obligation  of  EMIR,  can  AIFMs  rely  on  the 
valuation provided by the central counterparty (CCP)? 
Answer: No. The AIFMD framework requires AIFMs to have in place a process for proper and 
independent verification of the value of the OTC financial derivative transactions, even if they 
are centrally cleared. The valuation provided by the CCP can only serve as a point of reference 
for the verification performed by the AIFM.  Nevertheless, the AIFM should be able to justify 
any deviation from the valuation provided by the CCP. 
Question  2  [last  update  May  2017]: Where  an  AIF  is  subject  to  the  clearing  obligation  of 
Article 4(1) of EMIR, can it make use of the exemption for intragroup transactions (Article 4(2) 
of EMIR)? 
Answer: ESMA is of the view that in the case of AIFs the exemption for intragroup transactions 
should be construed narrowly, and that in most cases it will not be possible for the exemption 
to be used. An AIF can only make use of the exemption for intragroup transactions if it has 
been established to form part of the same group (as defined in Article 2(16) of EMIR) as the 
counterparty  to  the  OTC  derivative  contract  and  if  it  fulfils  all  the  criteria  for  intragroup 
transactions set out in Article 3(2)(a)(i)-(iv), (b), or (d) of EMIR. 
Article 3(2)(a)(iii) of EMIR requires both counterparties to be included in the same consolidation 
on a full basis. In addition, they have to be subject to appropriate centralised risk evaluation, 
measurement and control procedures, as well as fulfil other specific requirements set out in 
Article 3(2) of EMIR. 
An exemption to the clearing obligation based on Article 4(2) of EMIR can only be granted after 
a thorough case-by-case assessment, which will have to take into account whether the AIF 
has been established to form part of the same group as the counterparty to the OTC derivative 
contract and whether the AIF fulfils all the criteria set out in Article 3(2)(a), (b), or (d) of EMIR. 
Where an AIF is granted an intragroup exemption for the clearing obligation, it follows that the 
AIF will not be considered a distinct entity and will not be treated separately for other purposes 
under  EMIR  either,  in  particular  for  the  purpose  of  the  bilateral  margining  thresholds 
calculation. Therefore, the aggregate month-end average notional amount referred in Article 
28(1) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 shall be calculated at the group 
level (including the relevant AIF).

Section XIII: Impact of Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 (SFTR)16 on AIFMD 
Date last updated: 5 October 2017 
Question  1  [last  update  6  October  2016]:  Article  13  of  Regulation  (EU)  2015/2365  on 
transparency of securities financing transactions and of reuse and amending Regulation (EU) 
No 648/2012, requires UCITS management companies,  UCITS investment companies, and 
AIFMs to provide information to investors on the use made of SFTs and total return swaps in 
the annual report of each UCITS/AIF under management, as well as in each half-yearly report 
for  UCITS.  As  Article  13  applies  from  13  January  2017,  which  report  should  be  the  first  to 
include this disclosure? 
Answer:  The  information  should  be  included  in  the  next  annual  or  half-yearly  report  to  be 
published after 13 January 2017 which may relate to a reporting period beginning before that 
date. 
Question  2  [last  update  5  October  2017]:  Pursuant  to  Article  13  of  SFTR,  UCITS 
management companies, UCITS investment companies, and AIFMs (“UCITS/AIF managers”) 
shall inform investors on the use they make of SFTs and total return swaps in annual (UCITS 
and  AIFs)  and  half-yearly  (UCITS  only)  reports.  The  information  on  SFTs  and  total  return 
swaps shall include the data provided for in Section A of the Annex to SFTR. 
Should  this  data  be  reported  as  aggregate  data  (with  respect  to  the  whole  of  the  reporting 
period) or based on a snapshot (taken at the end of the reporting period)? 
Answer: The table below explains how each data item in Section A of the Annex to the SFTR 
should be reported. All data items should be reported as a snapshot, with the exception of the 
following:  
-  Data on reuse of collateral 
o  Cash collateral reinvestment returns to the collective investment undertaking. 
-  Data on return and cost for each type of SFTs and total return swaps 
o  broken  down  between  the  collective  investment  undertaking,  the  manager  of 
the  collective  investment  undertaking  and  third  parties  (e.g.  agent  lender)  in 
absolute terms and as a percentage of overall returns generated by that type of 
SFTs and total return swaps 
For each of the data items firms should not artificially alter their practices in a way that would 
lead to the reporting being misleading. 
The guidance provided by this Q&A is without prejudice to further work that ESMA intends to 
carry out in relation to the disclosure obligations for UCITS and AIFs under SFTR.

Regarding  the  field  “Cash  collateral  reinvestment  returns  to  the  collective  investment 
undertaking”, during the year the fund receives a certain amount of cash as collateral for SFTs 
which is invested and produces a return. All SFTs have a given duration (normally short term) 
and there may be several SFTs that are carried out on a number of occasions with repeated 
investments  and  divestments  of cash.  Due  to  the  possible  concatenation  of the  operations, 
there may be a certain amount of cash collateral which is constantly invested for the whole 
year and produces a return. One interpretation is that the SFTR requires managers to disclose 
at least the overall sum of the returns earned by the fund from all the investment operations 
made during the year with cash collateral. This sum may only be an income flow that covers 
the whole year and therefore the distinction between aggregate vs snapshot (i.e. flow vs stock 
data) is not meaningful, because it could be calculated in only one way. One alternative would 
be to state that this is  “aggregate” by definition. Another  alternative  would be to require the 
disclosure  of the  cash  collateral  investment return,  calculated  as the  sum  of the  cash flows 
received for the investment of SFTs cash collateral over the yearly average amount of cash 
collateral investments.   
The same reasoning applies to the field “Data on return and cost for each type of SFTs and 
total return swaps/broken down between the collective investment undertaking, the manager 
of the collective investment undertaking and third parties (e.g. agent lender) in absolute terms 
and as a percentage of overall returns generated by that type of SFTs and total return swaps”. 
The manager has to sum the inflows and outflows generated by all the operations during the 
year and disclose the two total amounts; again, there appears to be only one way to calculate 
the data required and the disclosure of rate of returns (gross and net of cost) could be required 
if deemed more appropriate.

Section XIV: Branches 
Date last updated: July 2018 
Question 1: What are the supervisory responsibilities of competent authorities in host Member 
States when an alternative investment fund manager provides investment services through a 
branch established in the host Member State? 
Answer: Under both the UCITS and the AIFM Directives, supervisory powers of competent 
authorities in relation to branches of UCITS management companies or alternative investment 
fund managers (AIFMs) established in a Member State that is not the home Member State are 
shared.  The  competent  authority  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  branch  is  located  (host 
Member State) is responsible for the supervision of the branch’s compliance with conduct rules 
referred  to  in  Article  17(5)  of  the  UCITS  Directive  and  Article  45(2)  of  the  AIFMD  and  the 
competent authority of the Member State in which the UCITS management company or the 
alternative investment fund manager is established (home Member State) is responsible for 
the supervision of the other requirements provided under the relevant applicable framework.17 
Neither the UCITS Directive nor the AIFMD provides for an explicit framework for the allocation 
of  supervisory  responsibilities  and  powers  for  those  cases  where  UCITS  management 
companies or AIFMs are authorised to carry out investment services set out in Article 6(3) of 
the UCITS Directive and Article 6(4) of the AIFMD and have branches providing those services 
in other Member States. ESMA is of the view that responsibilities of home and host Member 
States  should  be  identified  similarly  to,  and  consistently  with,  the  general  framework 
established  for  the  provision  of  activities  pursued  by  UCITS  management  companies  and 
AIFMs through branches as well as with the MiFID II framework regulating the supervision on 
the provision of investment services across the EU. This approach is in line with the division 
of responsibilities provided under the MiFID II framework. In accordance with Article 35(8) of 
MiFID II, the competent authority of the host Member State has the responsibility for ensuring 
that  the  services  provided  by  the  branch  of  an  investment  firm  or  a  credit  institution  in  its 
territory  comply  with  the  MiFID  II  requirements  under  Articles  24  (“General  principles  and 
information to clients”) and 25 (“Assessment of suitability and appropriateness and reporting 
to  clients”)  of  MiFID  II,  which  also  apply  to  UCITS  management  companies  and  AIFMs 
providing investment services.
