1  Introduction 
Background 
The final legislative texts of Directive 2014/65/EU1 (MiFID II) and Regulation (EU) No 600/20142 
(MiFIR) were approved by the European Parliament on 15 April 2014 and by the European 
Council on 13 May 2014. The two texts were published in the Official Journal on 12 June 2014 
and entered into force on the twentieth day following this publication – i.e. 2 July 2014. 
Many of the obligations under MiFID II and MiFIR were further specified in the Commission 
Delegated Directive3 and two Commission Delegated Regulations4 5, as well as regulatory and 
implementing  technical  standards  developed  by  the  European  Securities  and  Markets 
Authority (ESMA).  
MiFID II and MiFIR, together with the Commission delegated acts as well as regulatory and 
implementing technical standards will be applicable from 3 January 2018.  
Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to promote common supervisory approaches and practices in 
the  application  of  MiFID  II  and  MiFIR  in  relation  to  market  structures  topics.  It  provides 
responses  to  questions  posed  by  the  general  public,  market  participants  and  competent 
authorities in relation to the practical application of MiFID II and MiFIR.  
The content of this document is aimed at competent authorities and firms by providing clarity 
on the application of the MiFID II and MiFIR requirements.  
The content of this document is not exhaustive and it does not constitute new policy. 
Status  
The question and answer (Q&A) mechanism is a practical convergence tool used to promote 
common supervisory approaches and practices under Article 29(2) of the ESMA Regulation6.   
                                                 
1 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and 
amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU. 
2 Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments 
and amending Regulation (EU) N0 648/2012. 
3 Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 of 7 April 2016 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament 
and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  safeguarding  of  financial  instruments  and  funds  belonging  to  clients,  product  governance 
obligations and the rules applicable to the provision or reception of fees, commissions or any monetary or non-monetary benefits 
(OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 500–517). 
4 Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/565  of  25  April  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and defined 
terms for the purposes of that Directive (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 1–83). 
5 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/567 of 18 May 2016 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council with regard to definitions, transparency, portfolio compression and supervisory measures on product 
intervention and positions (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 90–116). 
6 Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European 
Supervisory  Authority  (European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority),  amending  Decision  No  716/2009/EC  and  repealing 
Commission Decision 2009/77/EC Regulation (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

Due  to  the  nature  of  Q&As,  formal  consultation  on  the  draft  answers  is  considered 
unnecessary. However, even if Q&As are not formally consulted on, ESMA may check them 
with  representatives  of  ESMA’s  Securities  and  Markets  Stakeholder  Group,  the  relevant 
Standing Committees’ Consultative Working Group or, where specific expertise is needed, with 
other external parties.  
ESMA will periodically review these Q&As on a regular basis to update them where required 
and to identify if, in a certain area, there is a need to convert some of the material into ESMA 
Guidelines and recommendations. In such cases, the procedures foreseen under Article 16 of 
the ESMA Regulation will be followed.  
The  Q&As  in  this  document  cover  only  activities  of  EU  investment  firms  in  the  EU,  unless 
specifically mentioned otherwise. Third country related issues, and in particular the treatment 
of  non-EU  branches  of  EU  investment  firms,  will  be  addressed  in  a  dedicated  third  country 
section. 
Questions and answers  
This document is intended to be continually edited and updated as and when new questions 
are  received.  The  date  on  which  each  section  was  last  amended  is  included  for  ease  of 
reference.

Question 1 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
Will disaggregation be required at the level of the market operator or at the level of each trading 
venue? 
Answer 1 
Disaggregation is required at the level of each trading venue for which the market operator or 
investment firm operating a trading venue has received a specific authorisation under MiFID 
II. 
 
Question 2 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
Article  1  of  RTS  147 states  that  market  operators  and  investment  firms  operating  a  trading 
venue  shall  provide  disaggregated  data  “on  request”.  Who  would  be  entitled  to  make  such 
requests? What constitutes a request in this context? How quickly do market operators and 
investment firms operating a trading venue need to respond to a request for unbundled data? 
Answer 2 
MiFIR requires the relevant data to be made available “to the public” in disaggregated form on 
reasonable commercial terms. As such, any individual or entity (whether or not a user of the 
trading  venue)  could  make  a  request  for  disaggregated  data  and  the  market  operator  or 
investment firm operating a trading venue has to provide the commercial terms to acquire the 
disaggregated data.  
As  part  of  those  commercial  terms  and  to  effectively  provide  access  to  the  arrangements 
employed for making public the information referred to in Articles 3, 4 and 6 to 11 of MiFIR, the 
market operator or investment firm operating a trading venue may impose non-discriminatory 
technical requirements on clients.  
The  request  for  disaggregated  data  could  be  in  any  format  provided  it  clearly  expresses  a 
request  for  the  disaggregated  data.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  market  operators  and 
investment firms operating a trading venue do not need to make disaggregated data available 
unless they have received a request to do so. 
Market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue should respond to requests 
for disaggregated data as quickly as practicable. The response should not be slower than to a

Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of the offering of pre-and post-
trade data and the level of disaggregation of data (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 142–144).

request for non-disaggregated data. Market operators and investment firms operating a trading 
venue should reply to requests falling in the same category within the same time frame.  
 
Question 3 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
Article 1(1)(b) of RTS 14 requires disaggregation by country of issue for shares. How should 
“country of issue” be interpreted? Is this also required for non-EU countries? 
Answer 3 
Country of issue should be interpreted as the home Member State of the issuer, as defined in 
Article 2(1)(i) of the Transparency Directive8, including where the issuer is incorporated in a 
third country.

3  Direct  Electronic  Access  (DEA)  and  algorithmic  trading 
 
 
 
 
[Last update: 04/10/2018] 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Does a simple algorithm qualify as algorithmic trading? 
Answer 1 
Yes. The fact that a person or firm undertakes trading activity by means of an algorithm which 
includes a small number of processes (e.g. makes quotes that replicate the prices made by a 
trading  venue)  does  not  disqualify  the  firm  running  such  algorithm  from  being  engaged  in 
algorithmic trading. 
 
Question 2 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
If  an  investment  firm  (firm  A)  merely  transmits  a  client’s  order  for  execution  to  another 
investment  firm  (firm  B)  who  uses  algorithmic  trading,  is  investment  firm  A  engaged  in 
algorithmic trading? 
Answer 2 
No. The transmission of an order for execution to another investment firm without performing 
any algorithmic trading activity is not algorithmic trading. 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
Can a functionality be considered as an Automated Order Router (AOR) if it submits the same 
order to several trading venues? Would that qualify as algorithmic trading?  
Answer 3 
According  to  Recital  22  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/5659,  an  AOR  is 
characterized by only determining the trading venue or trading venues to which the order has 
to be sent without changing any other parameter of the order (including modifying the size of 
the order by “slicing” it into “child” orders). In case the same unmodified order is sent to several 
trading venues to ensure execution and it is executed in one of these venues, the functionality 
                                                 
9 Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/565  of  25  April  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and defined 
terms for the purposes of that Directive (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 1–83).

can also cancel the unexecuted orders in the other venues without qualifying as algorithmic 
trading. 
 
Question 4 [Last update: 31/01/2017] 
Do the references to ‘market makers’ in MiFID II Article 2(1)(d)(i) and Article 2(1)(j) cover those 
market makers as defined under MiFID II Article 4(1)(7) or those firms engaged in a market 
making agreement according to Article 17(4) of MiFID II?  
Answer 4 
The  reference  to  market  makers’  in  MiFID  II  Article  2(1)(d)(i)  and  Article  2(1)(j) covers  both 
firms engaged in a market making agreement according to Article 17(4) of MiFID II and other 
market makers covered by Article 4(1)(7) of MiFID II. 
 
Question 5 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
How  should  the  identification  and  authorisation  take  place  for  those  firms  applying  a  High-
Frequency Trading (HFT) technique? 
Answer 5 
The mechanics of identifying whether a firm is deemed to be applying a HFT technique are 
detailed in Article 19 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565. Firms should review 
their  trading  activities  at  least  on  a  monthly  basis  to  self-assess  whether  an  authorisation 
requirement  has  been  triggered  over  the  course  of  the  period  in  question.  Upon  request, 
trading  venues  must  provide  their  members,  participants  or  clients  with  an  estimate  of  the 
average number of messages per second two weeks after the end of each calendar month. 
For  this  purpose,  trading  venues  should  only  include  messages  generated  by  algorithmic 
trading activity as identified by the member, participant or client.  
However,  the  onus  remains  on  firms  to  ensure  that  the  estimates  provided  by  the  trading 
venues accurately reflect their actual trading activity (and in particular that it only takes into 
account proprietary algorithmic trading activity on liquid instruments excluding, in the case of 
DEA providers, messages sent by DEA clients using the firm’s code).  
Where a firm engages in HFT (as described above) and is not authorised as an investment 
firm under MiFID II, the firm is required to immediately seek authorisation as required under 
Article 2(1)(d)(iii) of MiFID II.  
ESMA reminds that any firm engaged in algorithmic trading (including HFT) has to notify this 
circumstance to the national competent authority of its home Member State and to the national 
competent  authorities  of  the  trading  venues  at  which  it  engages  in  algorithmic  trading  as 
member or participant. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 6 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Given that the identification of HFT technique takes into account the previous twelve months 
of  trading  and  that  trading  venues  are  only  obliged  to  provide  the  data  under  Article  19  of 
Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/565  as  of  3  January  2018,  when  the  actual 
identification as high-frequency traders is expected to take place? 
Answer 6 
Trading venues are only required by Article 19(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2017/565 to provide estimates of the average of messages per second as of 3 January 2018. 
As a consequence, over 2018 trading venues have to provide the estimates corresponding to 
the  trading  activity  of  their  members/participants  from  3  January  2018  onwards.  Trading 
venues may only be able to provide those estimates taking into account the previous twelve 
months  of  trading  activity  in  the  second  week  of  February  2019.  Provided  that  their  2017 
records allow them so, trading venues may provide estimates taking into account the previous 
twelve months before that date. 
As of 3 January 2018, persons engaged in algorithmic trading are responsible for their own 
self-assessment to determine whether their trading activity meets the characteristics of HFT 
as set out under Article 4(1)(40) of MiFID II and Article 19 of Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU) 2017/565. If it is the case, they should proceed immediately as described in Answer 5. 
ESMA notes in this respect that the information provided by trading venues are only estimates 
that need to be refined according to each person’s own records of the messages sent. 
 
Question 7 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Can DEA users be identified as applying a HFT technique? 
Answer 7 
Yes. As clarified under Recital 20 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565, DEA 
users may be classified as HFTs if they meet the conditions set out under Article 4(1)(40) of 
MiFID II and Article 19 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565.  
In  order  to  assess  whether  a  DEA  user  meets  the  applicable  message  thresholds,  firms 
accessing  trading  venues  through  DEA  may  contact  their  DEA  provider  which  is  obliged  to 
record  the  data  relating  to  the  orders  submitted,  including  modifications  and  cancellations 
under Article 21(5) of RTS 610. 
                                                 
10 Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/589  of  19  July  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  regulatory  technical  standards  specifying  the  organisational  requirements  of 
investment firms engaged in algorithmic trading (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 417–448). 
18 
 
 
 
 
However, the onus remains on investment firms to ensure that the estimates provided by the 
DEA providers accurately reflect their actual trading activity (and in particular that it only takes 
into  account  proprietary  trading  activity  on  liquid  instruments  excluding,  in  the  case  of  DEA 
users sub-delegating the DEA provider’s code, messages sent by their own DEA clients).  
 
Question 8 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
When would an investment firm using only algorithms which draw human traders’ attention to 
trading opportunities qualify as engaged in algorithmic trading? 
Answer 8 
The use of algorithms which only serve to inform a trader of a particular investment opportunity 
is not considered as algorithmic trading, provided that the execution is not algorithmic.  
 
Question 9 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Does the MiFID II obligation relating to algorithmic trading  apply to electronic OTC trading? 
Are algorithms that provide quotes/orders to customers subject to the requirements set out in 
MiFID II? 
Answer 9 
Article 17 of MiFID II covers the trading activity that takes place on a trading venue. Therefore, 
OTC trading activity, such as the generation of quotes sent bilaterally to clients is not covered 
by the provisions in Article 17 of MiFID II (and any further requirements thereof). 
 
Question 10 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Please  explain  what  is  meant  by  Article  17(3)  of  RTS  6  which  requires  investment  firms  to 
“reconcile” their own electronic logs with information about their outstanding orders and risk 
exposures as provided by the trading venues to which they send orders, their brokers or DEA 
providers,  their  clearing  members  or  CCP,  their  data  providers  or  other  relevant  business 
partners?  
Answer 10 
The  goal  of  post-trade  controls  is  mainly  to  enable  firms  engaged  in  algorithmic  trading  to 
undertake appropriate management of their market and credit risk. To that end, and in order 
to make sure that post-trade controls are based on reliable information, Article 17(3) of RTS 6 
requires  investment  firms  to  reconcile  their  own  electronic  logs  with  information  about  their 
outstanding  orders  and  risk  exposures  as  provided  by  external  parties.  This  should  be 
19 
 
 
 
 
understood  as  an  obligation  to  compare  the  trading  activity’s  reports  generated  by  the 
investment  firm  itself  with  reports  from  other  external  sources.  This  should  contribute  in 
particular to: 
a)  Early detection of any discrepancy between the different data sources and mitigation 
of errors and malfunctions; 
b)  Accurate  calculation  of  the  firm’s  actual  exposure  (in  particular,  where  it  accesses 
different  multiple  trading  systems  and/or  brokers)  and  the  timely  generation  of 
adequate  alerts  before  the  position  and  loss  limits  set  out  by  the  firm  have  been 
breached. 
 
Question 11 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Are firms required to store market data in order to fulfil the requirements contained in Article 
13(7) of RTS 6 regarding the replay functionality of surveillance systems? 
Answer 11 
Under Article 13(1) of RTS 6, investment firms engaged in algorithmic trading are obliged to 
have in place monitoring systems capable of generating operable alerts to indicate potential 
market abuse. To that end, firms have to take into account not only their own message, order 
flow and transaction records but also information from other sources (trading venues, brokers, 
clearing  members,  CCPs,  data  providers,  relevant  business  partners  and  so  forth)  which 
constitute not  only the input used  to  generate messages  but  also the context of  the  trading 
activity.  
Under Article 13 of RTS 6 there is no obligation to store internally all the information from other 
sources as long as it is possible to retrieve that information to operate the replay function.  
Those  operable  alerts  may  lead  to  the  submission  to  the  national  competent  authority  of  a 
Suspicious Transaction or Order Report (STOR) under the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR)11. 
In particular, Article 5(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/95712 prescribes that 
the information submitted as part of a STOR has to be based on facts and analysis, taking into 
account all information available to them. Additionally, there is an obligation to maintain for a 
period of five years the information documenting the analysis carried out with regard to orders 
and  transactions  that  could  constitute  market  abuse  which  have  been  examined  and  the 
reasons  for  submitting  or  not  submitting  a  STOR.  That  information  shall  be  provided  to  the 
                                                 
11 Regulation  (EU)  596/2014  f  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  16  April  2014  on  market  abuse  (market  abuse 
regulation)  and  repealing  Directive  2003/6/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  and  Commission  Directives 
2003/124/EC, 2003/125/EC and 2004/72/EC (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 1–61) 
12 Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/957  of  9  March  2016  supplementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  596/2014  of  the 
European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the appropriate arrangements, systems 
and procedures as well as notification templates to be used for preventing, detecting and reporting abusive practices or suspicious 
orders or transactions (OJ L 160, 17.6.2016, p. 1–14).

competent  authority  upon  request  (Article  3(8)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/957). 
 
Question 12 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Article 20 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 further clarifies the definition 
of direct electronic access as per Article 4(1)(41) of MiFID II by stating that persons shall be 
considered not capable of electronically transmitting orders relating to a financial instrument 
directly to a trading venue in accordance with Article 4(1)(41) of MiFID II where that person 
cannot  exercise  discretion  regarding  the  exact  fraction  of  a  second  of  order  entry  and  the 
lifetime of the order within that timeframe. What does “exercise discretion regarding the exact 
fraction of a second” mean? 
Answer 12 
One of the benefits of accessing a trading venue by DEA is in the ability of the firm submitting 
the  order  to  exercise  greater  control  over  the  timing  of  order  submission.  The  use  of  DEA 
without  passing  through  appropriate  control  filters  of  the  provider  of  DEA  and  those  of  the 
trading venue, is not permitted under MiFID II. Such filters add minimal, but a finite amount of 
delay to the order reaching the matching engine of the trading venue and as such some may 
preclude the possibility of a firm submitting such an order to exercise discretion regarding the 
exact fraction of a second. 
However, the phrase in question should be construed as whether the DEA user in question is 
able to exercise discretion regarding the exact fraction of a second in sending an order, not 
the exact timing of an order reaching the matching engine. This is a natural interpretation given 
that  current network  routing  technology  cannot  provide  certainty  for  a  message  to  reach  its 
destination with the precision of “exact fraction of a second”. 
 
Question 13 [Last update: 31/05/2017] 
What is meant by “continuous” assessment and monitoring of market and credit risk in Article 
17(2) of RTS 6 which relates to investment firms’ post trade controls? 
Answer 13 
Article 17(2) of RTS 6 includes as part of the post-trade controls that investment firms engaged 
in algorithmic trading must have in place the ‘continuous assessment and monitoring of market 
and credit risk of the investment firm in terms of effective exposure’.  
Since  there  is  no  requirement  to  operate  this  continuous  assessment  in  real-time  on  an 
ongoing basis, intraday and/or end of day checks as appropriate can be carried out at entity 
level. However, it is noted that the investment firm must have the capability to calculate in real 
time if necessary and on the basis of the information that it has: a) its outstanding exposure; 
21 
 
 
 
 
b) the outstanding exposure of each of its traders and c) the outstanding exposure of clients 
(Article 17(3) RTS 6). 
ESMA  notes  that  for  that  purpose,  the  reconciliation  of  the  firm’s  own  records  with  those 
provided by trading venues, clearing members, central counterparties, brokers, DEA providers 
or any other business partners must be made in real time when those counterparties provide 
the information in real time.  
 
Question 14 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Does the format established for the record-keeping obligations of HFT firms established in RTS 
6 apply to their non-algorithmic trading desks? 
Answer 14 
In addition to the general obligation of investment firms to maintain records of all orders and 
transactions  in  financial  instruments  under  Article  25  of  MiFIR,  Article  17(2)  of  MiFID  II 
establishes the obligation of investment firms engaged in HFT “to store in an approved form 
accurate and time sequenced records of all its placed orders, including cancellations of orders, 
executed orders and quotations on trading venues”. 
For  investment  firms  simultaneously  engaging  in  HFT  and  non-HFT  activities  there  are  two 
formats that have to be considered:  
  The format established in Annex 2 of RTS 6 has to be used to record the messaging 
activity related to activity using HFT technique. ESMA considers that ‘activity using HFT 
technique’  only  includes  the  algorithmic  proprietary  trading  activity  of  the  firm  on  a 
trading  venue  with  respect  to  any  liquid  instruments  (see  Article  19  of  Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565).  
With respect of the timestamping of those records (see fields 23 and 24 of table 3 of 
Annex II of RTS 6), the activity using HFT technique has to be timestamped within 1 
microsecond or better (Table 2 of Annex to RTS 25, to which RTS 6 cross-refers). 
  Non-HFT  activity  has  to  be  recorded  under  the  format  established  by  Commission 
Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/565.  However,  nothing  prevents  these  investment 
firms from using Annex 2 of RTS 6 to record their non-HFT trading activity if their NCA 
so agrees. 
ESMA  reminds  that  all  other  non-HFT  algorithmic  trading  activity  should  be 
timestamped  in  one  millisecond  or  better  as  provided  for  under  ‘any  other  trading 
activity’  as  specified  in  Table  2  of  the  Annex  of  RTS  25,  to  which  Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 cross-refers.  
 
22 
 
 
 
 
Question 15 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Article  2(2)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/582  (RTS  26)  requires  trading 
venues to provide tools to ensure pre-execution screening on an order-by-order basis by each 
clearing member of the limits set and maintained by that clearing member for its client pursuant 
to RTS 6. Which specific provision of RTS 6 is the reference to limits in Article 2(2) of RTS 26 
referring to? 
Answer 15 
The reference made to RTS 6 in Article 2(2) of RTS 26 is referring to Article 26 of RTS 6. 
 
Question 16 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Article 2(1) of RTS 26 provides an exemption from pre-trade, order-by-order checking for on-
venue traded cleared derivatives if certain conditions are met. When this exemption applies to 
clearing members, does it also exempt clearing members from the requirement under Article 
26(2) of RTS 6 to have “appropriate pre-trade and post-trade procedures for managing the risk 
of breaches of position limits”? 
Answer 16 
General  clearing  members  and  trading  venues  are  not  required  to  subject  client  orders  for 
cleared derivative transactions on a trading venue to the relevant pre-trade checks required 
under  RTS  26  where  the  conditions  set  out  in  Article  2(1)  of  RTS  26  are  met.  However, 
pursuant to Article 26(2) of RTS 6, they should have other pre-trade procedures to manage 
the risk of breaches of position limits by their clients, by way of appropriate margining practice 
and other means. 
 
Question 17 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Does  the  ‘kill  functionality’  require  having  to  integrate  different  systems  in-house  using  a 
software approach so that a single button can cancel all orders in all asset classes for all house 
trading and client trading? 
Answer 17 
The requirement for an investment firm to have a kill functionality pursuant to Article 12 of RTS 
6 obliges the firm to have the ability as an emergency measure to immediately pull any or all 
outstanding  orders  from  any  or  all  trading  venues.  ESMA  considers  that  effective  kill 
functionality  is  essential  for  ensuring  adequate  risk  management  and  safeguarding  of  the 
orderly functioning of the market, given the risks to which algorithmic trading firms are exposed, 
in particular in situations where an algorithm is not behaving as expected.  
23 
 
 
 
 
In  practical  terms,  this  does  not  create  an  obligation  for  all  systems  connecting  the  firm  to 
different  trading  venues  to  be  implemented  through  a  single  unified  piece  of  software,  in 
particular when the investment firm comprises different trading systems. The functionality can 
comprise both procedures and switches that should be adjusted to the characteristics of the 
systems operated by the investment firm. For instance, when there is a unified system, a button 
could be set at the highest level of the system, with adequate and gradual procedures so as 
to limit risks of disorderly markets conditions. In any case, a single decision of the investment 
firm should be able to result in an immediate withdrawal of all orders or any subset of them. 
 
Question 18 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Under Article 3(2)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/580 (RTS 24), there is 
a requirement to flag orders submitted to a trading venue “as part of a market making strategy 
pursuant to Articles 17 and 48 of [MiFID II]”. Should a firm start flagging orders when it decides 
to  submit  orders  with  a  view  to  make  markets  in  a  particular  instrument,  or  only  when  it 
concludes  a  formal  agreement  with  the  trading  venue  subsequent  to  triggering  such  an 
obligation under Article 1 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/578 (RTS 8)? 
Answer 18 
The  primary  purpose  of  flagging  as  required  under  Article  3(2)(a)  of  RTS  24  is  to  enable 
efficient detection of market manipulation by distinguishing the order flow from an investment 
firm based on pre-determined terms established by the issuer or the trading venue from the 
order flow of the investment firm acting at its own discretion (see Recital 6 of RTS 24). 
ESMA therefore expects that only those orders submitted to a trading venue as part of a market 
making strategy subsequent to the conclusion of a market making agreement with the relevant 
trading venue should be flagged as such in field 8 as designated in Table 2 of the Annex of 
RTS 24. The same applies to field 3 of Table 3 of Annex II of RTS 6. 
 
Question 19 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Could trading venues set out different OTRs for different types of market participants (e.g. firms 
engaged in a market making scheme)? 
Answer 19 
As clarified by Recital 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/566 (RTS 9) trading 
venues  may  set  the  maximum  ratio  of  unexecuted  orders  to  transactions  at  the  level  they 
consider appropriate to prevent excessive volatility in the financial instrument concerned.  
Nothing prevents trading venues from setting the limits on the basis of the different categories 
of  market  participants  that  operate  in  their  systems.  In  particular,  trading  venues  may 
determine a specific limit ratio for members or participants subject to market making obligations 
24 
 
 
 
 
under  a  written  agreement  (Article  17(2)  of  MiFID  II)  or  a  market  making  scheme  (Article 
48(2)(b) of MiFID II).  
The ratio limiting the number of unexecuted orders to transactions should be set in compliance 
with the objective of Article 48 of MiFID II and supported by statistical analysis of the activity 
of  the different categories  of  members or  participants  and the liquidity of  the instruments in 
which they operate. 
 
Question 20 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
In terms of the Order to Trade Ratio (OTR), how should a trading venue tackle cases where a 
market participant has executed no trades after the submission of a high number of orders? 
Answer 20 
RTS 9 describes the methodology to calculate the actual OTR incurred by each member or 
participant  of  a  trading  venue  using  a  fraction.  In  case  there  have  been  no  trades,  a  strict 
application of the proposed methodology is not possible since one cannot divide by zero.  
ESMA is of the view that trading venues should consider that the maximum OTR has been 
breached  if  the  orders  submitted  without  executing  one  single  transaction  surpassed  the 
maximum authorised number of orders that can be sent for one transaction being executed. 
For instance if the maximum OTR set by the trading is 10, members or participants should not 
sent more than 10 orders without executing one transaction. 
 
Question 21 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Article 1(2)(d) of RTS 8 establishes that quotes shall be deemed to have competitive prices 
where they are posted at or within the maximum bid-ask range set by the trading venue. Does 
this  mean  that  trading  venues  have  to  have  published  maximum  bid-ask  ranges  for  all 
instruments traded on their venues or only for the instruments on which they have a market 
making scheme in place? 
Answer 21 
There  are  two  different  obligations  when  an  investment  firm  is  pursuing  a  market  making 
strategy in trading venues allowing or enabling algorithmic trading through their systems:  
a)  There is a generic obligation, not restricted to specific financial instruments, for trading 
venues to sign written market making agreements with all investment firms pursuing a 
market  making  strategy  on  their  systems  (Article  48(2)  and  Article  17(3)  and  (4)  of 
MiFID II) when the circumstances described in Article 1(2) of RTS 8 are met; and 
25 
 
 
 
 
b)  Trading venues must have market making schemes in place only with respect to the 
instruments listed in Article 5 of RTS 8.  
In order for investment firms to assess whether they are posting competitive prices on a trading 
venue and may therefore potentially qualify as engaging into a market making strategy, and 
have to enter into a market making agreement, trading venues enabling or allowing algorithmic 
trading through their systems must make public a maximum bid-ask range for each financial 
instrument they made available for trading.  
ESMA notes that trading venues may group financial instruments when setting the maximum 
bid-ask spread for these purposes. 
 
Question 22 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Under which circumstances a trading venue may cancel, vary or correct a transaction? 
Answer 22 
Trading venues enabling or allowing algorithmic trading through their systems shall be able to 
cancel or revoke transactions in case of malfunctioning of the trading venue’s mechanisms to 
manage  volatility  or  of  the  trading  system  in  the  context  of  disorderly  trading  conditions, 
according to Article 18 of RTS 7.  
However, Article 47(1)(d) of MiFID II also establishes the general organisational requirement 
for all trading venues “to have transparent and non-discriminatory rules and procedures that 
provide for fair and orderly trading and establish objective criteria for the efficient execution of 
orders”. Therefore, the rulebook of a trading venue may foresee other exceptional situations 
in which transactions might be cancelled provided that those situations are transparent and 
non-discriminatory. 
 
Question 23 [Last update: 03/10/2017] 
Are  the  suitability  checks  and  controls  a  DEA  provider  should  perform  on  clients  using  the 
service also applicable in case of clients that are not investment firms authorised in the EU? 
Where a DEA client extends its access to its own clients, is the DEA provider responsible for 
the conduct of these sub-delegated clients? 
Answer 23 
Yes, the obligations that fall on a DEA provider as per Article 17(5) of MiFID II and as specified 
in RTS 6 apply regardless whether the client is an authorised EU investment firms or not. In 
particular, the DEA provider retains responsibility for all clients accessing an EU trading venue 
through its DEA, including the sub-delegated DEA clients, in relation to the requirements  of 
Article 17(5) of MiFID II as well as provisions of Articles 19 to 23 of RTS 6. 
26 
 
 
 
 
In order to fulfil its responsibility, the DEA provider must have access to information on its DEA 
clients,  irrespective  of  DEA  clients’  jurisdiction  or  their  authorisation  status.  A  DEA  provider 
may not provide services to its clients, including sub-delegated clients, unless all information 
can be made available to the Competent Authority of the trading venue for its supervisory and 
enforcement purposes.  
The DEA provider should also clarify in the binding written agreement that the DEA service will 
be suspended or withdrawn from the client if the provider is not satisfied that continued access 
would  be  consistent  with  its  rules  and  procedures  for  fair  and  orderly  trading  and  market 
integrity - this includes a situation where the client fails to supply a reasonable explanation for 
a suspicious trading pattern or inappropriate trading behaviour that may involve market abuse. 
Where a DEA sub-delegation is allowed, the DEA provider should require its DEA clients to 
have  a  provision  to  enable  the  DEA  provider  to  have  access  to  information  on  their  sub-
delegated clients’ trading activities for the express purpose of enabling the DEA provider to 
provide information to the Competent Authority of the trading venue. 
Furthermore, trading venues must observe Article 22(3) of RTS 7 when permitting sponsored 
access, and where appropriate DMA, to their members and participants. TVs should clearly 
state in their rules the circumstance in which the TV suspends or terminates the provision of 
DEA, for example, where the conduct of a DEA client is reasonably suspected to be abusive. 
 
Question 24 [Last update: 15/11/2017] 
Can DEA clients accessing an EU trading venue through sub-delegated DEA benefit from the 
exemption offered under Article 2(1)(d) of MiFID II? 
Answer 24 
Article 2(1)(d) of MiFID II exempts  persons dealing on own account in financial instruments 
from the requirement to be authorised as a MiFID investment firm. However, it also lists a set 
of  circumstances  where  such  an  exemption  does  not  apply,  including  where  such  persons 
have DEA to a trading venue. 
Article 4(1)(41) of MiFID II defines DEA as “an arrangement where a member or participant or 
client  of  a  trading  venue  permits  a  person  to  use  its  trading  code  so  the  person  can 
electronically transmit orders relating to a financial instrument directly to the trading venue”. A 
person who directly interacts with the member to obtain the use of the trading code will be the 
person granted permission under an arrangement. The DEA provider has direct knowledge of 
that person’s use and must be taken to allow it; such a person (Tier 1 DEA client) therefore 
should be understood to have DEA to a trading venue. 
However, in some cases a DEA provider may allow a DEA user to sub-delegate the access 
rights onto a third entity (Tier 2 DEA client). Unlike a Tier 1 DEA client who directly interacts 
with  the  member  to  obtain  the  use  of  the  trading  code,  a  Tier  2  DEA  client  would,  in  most 
27 
 
 
 
 
cases, not technically be in possession of the trading code of a DEA provider. The trading code 
is not passed down to the ultimate users of DEA, but only appended to the order message by 
the  DEA  provider  before  being  submitted  to  the  trading  venue.  Therefore,  ESMA  does  not 
consider such Tier 2 DEA clients as having DEA for the purposes of Article 2(1)(d) of MiFID II.  
ESMA notes that any risks posed by Tier 2 DEA clients are indirectly regulated through the 
provisions of Article 17(5) of MiFID II as well as Articles 22 and 23 of RTS 6.  
In addition, Article 21(4) of RTS 6 requires the DEA providers to be able to identify the different 
order flows from the beneficiaries of such sub-delegation without being required to know the 
identity of the beneficiaries of such arrangement. 
 
Question 25 [Last update: 15/11/2017] 
Does a firm need to be authorised as an investment firm under MiFID II to provide DEA to an 
EU trading venue? 
Answer 25 
Yes,  Article  48(7)  of  MiFID  II  provides  that  trading  venues  should  only  permit  a  member  or 
participant to provide DEA “if they are investment firms authorised  under [MiFID II] or credit 
institution authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU”. Therefore, non-EU firms (including non-EU 
firms  licensed  in  an  equivalent  jurisdiction)  or  EU  firms  without  a  MiFID  II  licence  are  not 
allowed to provide DEA to their clients. This applies regardless of where the clients using the 
DEA service are located. 
 
Question 26 [Last update: 04/10/2018] *new* 
Article 6 of RTS 8 requires trading venues to set the incentives and the requirements that must 
be  met  by  investment  firms  in  order  to  access  those  incentives  under  stressed  market 
conditions,  taking  into  account  the  additional  risks.  What  are  the  types  of  incentives  to  be 
provided  under  stressed  market  conditions  by  the  trading  venues  to  comply  with  this 
requirement? 
Answer 26 
RTS  8  sets  forth  an  obligation  for  trading  venues  to  provide  incentives  to  market  makers 
“effectively  contributing to  liquidity  provision  under  stressed  market  conditions”  (Recital  8  of 
RTS 8). To this end, the market making schemes should “clearly indicate the conditions for 
accessing incentives and should take into account the effective contribution to the liquidity in 
the trading venue measured in terms of presence, size and spread by the participants in the 
schemes” (Recital 9 of RTS 8). 
28 
 
 
 
 
On the basis of the individual trading system, trading venues still have the ability to adjust their 
scheme of incentives, which may well be of a “monetary” or “non-monetary” nature as long as 
they  effectively  support  trading  and  provision  of  liquidity  to  the  market  on  a  regular  and 
predictable basis and in particular when it is the most volatile. 
In particular, trading venues should not induce market makers to leave an already depleted 
market  or  to  privilege  normal  market  conditions  over  stressed  ones.  This  means  that  those 
schemes  where  an  incentive  is  given  to  all  market  makers  regardless  of  whether  they 
effectively  meet  the  requirements  in  terms  of  presence,  size  and  spread  set  by  the  trading 
venues under stressed market conditions would not comply with RTS 8 obligations. 
Similarly,  trading  venues  can  impose  different  market  making  quoting  obligations  during 
normal and stressed markets, provided that they should always be bound by Article 2(1)(b) of 
RTS 8. In this regard, relaxation of market making obligations should not be construed as an 
incentive. 
 
Question 27 [Last update: 04/10/2018] *new* 
In the context of RTS 9, which is the order-counting methodology for bulk quotes? 
Answer 27 
A bulk quote is a bundle of multiple quotes, possibly on several financial instruments. As per 
Article 3 of RTS 9, where the methodology for counting orders for a specific order type is not 
detailed, the trading venue “shall count the messages in accordance with the general system 
behind the methodology outlined and on the basis of the most similar order type appearing in 
the Annex”. According to the methodology in RTS 9, calculations should be performed at the 
level of each financial instrument and, furthermore, the Annex specifies that each quote should 
be counted as two orders (one for the buy side and one for the sell side). Accordingly, each 
order/quote sent within a bulk quote, should be treated individually and be counted as specified 
in the Annex of RTS 9. 
 
Question 28 [Last update: 04/10/2018] *new* 
Do the provisions of Article 17(6) of MiFID II and of Chapter IV of RTS 6 apply to all general 
clearing members or only to those clearing members having algorithmic traders as clients? 
Answer 28 
Article 17(6) of MiFID II targets investment firms acting as general clearing members, without 
mentioning  algorithmic  trading  nor  restricting  the  scope  to  those  clearing  members  having 
algorithmic traders as clients. Therefore, Article 17(6) should be interpreted as applying to all 
firms acting as general clearing members, regardless of the nature of their clients. Analogously, 
the provisions in Chapter IV of RTS 6 are drafted without any reference to algorithmic trading 
29 
 
 
 
 
and should apply to all general clearing members. This reading is reinforced by Recital 1 of 
RTS 6, which defines the scope of RTS 6 differentiating on the one hand “Investment firms 
engaged  in  algorithmic  trading”  and,  on  the  other  hand,  those  “providing  direct  electronic 
access or acting as general clearing members”. 
The  title  of  Article  17  and  RTS  6  should  not  be  interpreted  as  narrowing  the  scope  of  the 
provisions in question, but rather suggesting that the issues addressed are more prominent 
with respect to algorithmic trading.

4  The tick size regime [Last update: 28/03/2018] 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
Which  National  Competent  Authority  (NCA)  should  be  responsible  for  calculating  and 
publishing the average daily number of transactions (ADNT) and in particular in the case of 
multi-listed instruments? 
Answer 1 
The relevant NCA responsible calculating and publishing the ADNT should be the competent 
authority identified as the NCA of most relevant market in terms for the purposes of transaction 
reporting.  In  the  case  of  multi-listed  instruments,  the  criteria  and  procedure  to  be  used  for 
determining which NCA should be the relevant NCA are specified under Article 16 of RTS 2213.  
For  new  instruments,  Article  16  of  RTS  22  clarifies  that  the  most  relevant  market  for  the 
financial  instrument  is  the  market  of  the  Member  State  in  which  a  request  for  admission  to 
trading was first made or where the instrument was first traded. The NCA of this Member State 
will  be  responsible  for  publishing  the  estimates  and  preliminary  calculations  as  per  the 
procedure set out under Article 3(5) and (6) of RTS 1114.  
Where the relevant NCA has concluded an agreement with ESMA, the ADNT will be published 
centrally  on  the  ESMA  website.  For  other  NCAs,  the  ADNT  will  be  published  on  the  ESMA 
website on a best-effort basis.  
 
Question 2 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
Which types of corporate actions for an instrument may trigger a recalculation of ADNT? 
Answer 2 
Any corporate actions that the relevant NCA anticipates will lead to a material change in the 
average daily number of trades after the event may initiate the recalculation process per Article 
4 of RTS 11. Normally such a circumstance may arise when the issuer plans to undertake, 
amongst  other  things, share  buybacks  or  share  issuance  which  will  result  in  the instrument 
continuing  to  trade  in  a  liquidity  band  that  would  not  be  optimal  unless  a  recalculation  is 
undertaken.

Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  regulatory  technical  standards  for  the  reporting  of  transactions  to  competent 
authorities (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 449–478). 
14 Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/588  of  14  July  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European

and exchange-traded funds (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 411–416). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
Are non-EU instruments in scope and how the calculation of ADNT should be performed for 
those instruments? 
Answer 3 
Non-EU instruments are included in the scope of the Article 49 regime as soon as they are 
traded  on  a  trading  venue  in  the  Union.  The  applicable  liquidity  band  is  determined  by  the 
relevant NCA taking into account the ADNT on the most relevant market in terms of liquidity 
according to Article 4 of RTS 1. Trading activity taking place outside of the Union should not 
be considered for these purposes. 
 
Question 4 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
How is a liquidity band applied for instruments  trading in different currencies across trading 
venues? 
Answer 4 
Once  a  particular  liquidity  band  is  assigned  to  an  instrument,  trading  of  that  instrument  will 
continue within that band until another liquidity band is assigned as a result of periodical or ad 
hoc review by the relevant NCA or ESMA. As set out in Recital 8 of RTS 11, the same liquidity 
band will be applied irrespective of the currency denomination used for the quotation of the 
financial instrument. 
 
Question 5 [Last update: 18/11/2016] 
Can a trading venue or NCA manually intervene to allow a smaller tick size if it can be shown 
that the mandated minimum tick size is adversely impacting liquidity? 
Answer 5 
No, except where there has been a corporate action event in which the NCA concerned will 
consider assigning a different liquidity band according to its estimate of the ADNT occurring in 
the most liquid venue following the said corporate action event. 
 
Question 6 [Last update: 18/12/2017] 
Does the minimum tick size regime under Article 49 of MiFID II apply to all orders for which a 
pre-trade transparency waiver can be granted in accordance with Article 4 of MiFIR? 
32 
 
 
 
 
Answer 6 
Article 49 of MiFID II requires trading venues to adopt minimum tick sizes in relation to equity 
and  certain  equity-like  instruments.  RTS  11  specifies  the  minimum  tick  size  regime  which 
applies  to  those  instruments  depending  on  their  liquidity  and  price  level.  As  the  aim  of  the 
minimum  tick  size  regime  is  to  ensure  the  orderly  functioning  of  the  market,  its  application 
extends to all orders submitted to trading venues. The application of the tick size regime would 
include, for example, limit orders resting on an order book, orders held in an order management 
system as well as LIS orders pegged to the mid-point in a lit order book (in practice those LIS 
orders can only be pegged to the mid-point where the spread consists of an even number of 
ticks).  
However, the minimum tick size regime would not apply to transactions executed in systems 
that  match  orders  on  the  basis  of  a  reference  price  as  per  Article  4(1)(a)  of  MiFIR,  or  to 
negotiated transactions as per Article 4(1)(b) of MiFIR. 
 
Question 7 [Last update: 19/12/2016] 
What happens to orders remaining on the order book at the moment the tick size increases? 
Answer 7 
Trading venues have discretion to set the rules covering the treatment of orders remaining on 
the book at the moment the minimum tick size increases, including whether or not such orders 
are  to  be  cancelled  or  amended.  Trading  venues  are  responsible  to  disclose  those  rules 
appropriately. Trading venues must also observe the requirement to enforce the minimum tick 
size for orders submitted after that tick size comes into force. 
 
Question 8 [Last update: 28/03/2018] 
If the ADNT for an instrument is not available, which liquidity band should trading venues apply 
until the ADNT is published by NCA or ESMA? When can the trading venue proceed to adopt 
such a liquidity band? 
Answer 8 
In  the  event  of  the  ADNT  not  being  published  by  ESMA  or,  where  applicable  the  NCA,  all 
relevant trading venues would need to apply a harmonised default tick size pending such a 
publication to ensure a uniform tick size regime across the Union.  
For an instrument that is admitted to trading or traded in the EU, where the applicable ADNT 
remains unavailable, trading venues should assign the highest liquidity band (i.e. liquidity band 
for instrument with an ADNT ≥ 9,000) to the instrument in question for the purpose of the tick 
33 
 
 
 
 
size regime. This default regime should apply until the actual publication of the ADNT by ESMA 
or by the relevant NCAs. ADNTs published should apply the day after their publication.  
 
Question 9 [Last update: 03/10/2017] 
In  case  of  a  simultaneous  dual  listing,  shall  an  NCA  be  appointed  for  the  purpose  of 
determining the estimated average daily number of shares and establishing the applicable tick 
size? 
Answer 9 
Yes, the ESMA website will always display one NCA as the NCA of the most relevant market 
in terms of liquidity as per Article 26 of MiFIR. 
 
Question 10 [Last update: 15/11/2017] 
Does the mandatory tick size regime apply to both orders and quotes? 
Answer 10 
Yes, the minimum tick size established under Article 49 of MiFID II and further specified in RTS 
11 should apply to both orders and quotes. This regime is meant to create a level playing field 
between the different trading venues and the reference to “orders” in Article 2 of RTS 11 should 
not be interpreted as restricting the application of the tick size regime to only certain types of 
trading systems but, on the contrary, should be understood in the broadest sense.

5.1  General 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 31/01/2017] 
Can an MTF operator be a member/participant of its own MTF? 
Answer 1 
Whether an MTF operator may become a member of its own MTF requires the application of 
two different MiFID II articles.  
Article 19 of MiFID II does not prevent an investment firm operating an MTF to be a member 
of  its  own  MTF.  However,  Article  19(5)  prohibits  investments  firms  and  market  operators 
operating an MTF to execute client orders against proprietary capital, or to engage in matched 
principal trading. As a consequence, the investment firm could only operate on its own MTF 
through pure agency trading.   
Article 18(4) also requires the operator of an MTF to have arrangements to identify clearly and 
manage the potential adverse consequences for the operation of the MTF or for its members 
or participants, of any conflict of interests between the MTF, their owners or the investment 
firm and market operator operating an MTF and its sound functioning.  
Appropriate management of conflict of interest is all the more important to ensure the effective 
implementation of Article 31 of MiFID II, which requires investment firms and market operators 
operating an MTF to monitor the compliance of its members and participants with the rules of 
the MTF and with other legal obligations.  
Therefore, unless otherwise demonstrated by adequate and effective internal arrangements 
and procedures, ESMA is of the view that the potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a 
result  of  this  would  only  be  managed  effectively  by  means  of  operating  the  MTF  and  the 
membership through different legal entities.   
To ensure that having two separate legal entities serves a meaningful purpose, ESMA is of the 
view that the two investment firms should have arrangements in place that prevent information 
sharing on each other’s activities. This would include for instance having distinct management 
and operational teams and physical separation of activities. Similarly, whereas some elements 
of  the  IT  infrastructure  could  be  shared,  execution  systems  would  be  expected  to  be 
segregated and safeguards to be put in place to prevent information leakage across the two 
35 
 
 
 
 
entities.  Outsourcing  from  one  legal  entity  to  the  other  should  only  take  place  where  the 
arrangements meet a similar test.  
The  arrangements  described  above  shall  be  without  prejudice  to  the  ability  of  the  MTF  to 
monitor its participants for compliance with market rules and other legal obligations and also 
without prejudice to the MiFID II provisions on identification and management of conflicts of 
interest to be met by each of the two investment firms. 
 
Question 2 [Last update: 31/01/2017] 
Would a trading venue locating its electronic systems on a third party data centre be required 
to comply with the co-location provisions under RTS 1015 even where the venue is not providing 
the co-location service? 
Answer 2 
The principle underpinning Article 1 of RTS 10 is to ensure that electronic access to trading 
venues is fair and based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. A trading venue should 
seek to ensure that this principle is not violated even when the connectivity service is provided 
by a third-party to members, participants or a client of the trading venue.  
Therefore, the trading venue should take all the necessary steps to ensure that the third party 
proximity  hosting  service  provider  offers  a  fair  and  non-discriminatory  access  to  all 
members/participants/clients  of  the  trading  venue  subscribing  to  such  services.  Such  a 
requirement may include the conclusion or amendment of an agreement between the trading 
venue and the service provider so as to remain fully compliant with the provisions in RTS 10. 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Article 18(3) of MiFID II requires that investment firms and market operators operating an MTF 
or  OTF  establish,  publish  and  maintain  and  implement  transparent  and  non-discriminatory 
rules,  based  on  objective  criteria,  governing  access  to  its  facility.  A  similar  requirement  is 
applied  to  regulated  markets  through  Article  53(1)  of  MiFID  II.  What  sort  of  behaviour  or 
restrictions should be considered as non-objective, or discriminatory? 
Answer 3 
One of the benefits of more on-venue, pre-trade transparent trading is to broaden access to 
liquidity for market participants. In order for these benefits to be fully realised, it is important 
                                                 
15 Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/573  of  6  June  2016  supplementing  Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments with regard to regulatory technical standards on requirements 
to ensure fair and non-discriminatory co-location services and fee structures (OJ L 87, 31.3.2017, p. 145–147). 
36 
 
 
 
 
that  trading  venues  do  not  have  restrictive  criteria  governing  their  access,  which  place 
unreasonable restraints on certain market participants’ access to particular liquidity pools. 
In  particular, ESMA  does  not consider the following arrangements to  be  in compliance  with 
Articles 18(3) and 53(1) of MiFID II. This is not, however, an exhaustive list of arrangements 
which are non-objective and discriminatory.  
a)  Trading  venues  should  not  require  members  or  participants  to  be  direct  clearing 
members of a CCP. 
Given the protections afforded to non-clearing members under MiFIR and EMIR, as well as 
the  rules  on  straight  through  processing  (STP),  a  trading  venue  should  not  require  all  its 
members or participants to be direct clearing members of a CCP. Trading venues may however 
require  members  or  participants  to  enter  into,  and  maintain,  an  agreement  with  a  clearing 
member as a condition for access when trading is centrally cleared. 
b)  For  financial  instruments  that  are  centrally  cleared,  trading  venues  should  not  allow 
members or participants to require other members or participants to be enabled before 
they are allowed to trade with each other. 
There are legitimate checks that a trading venue might carry out before allowing a member or 
participant  on  to  their  venue.  For  example,  in  markets  for  non-centrally  cleared  financial 
instruments trading venues may wish to carry out credit checks, or ensure that a member or 
participant  has  appropriate  capital  to  support  the  positions  it  intends  to  take  on  the  trading 
venue. In a non-centrally cleared derivatives market, there may be a need for bilateral master 
netting  agreements  to  be  in  place  between  participants  before  the  trading  venue  can  allow 
their trading interests to interact. Trading venues will also need to be comfortable that potential 
participants are meeting the regulatory requirements to be a member of a trading venue such 
as having appropriate systems and controls to ensure fair and orderly trading.   
However, in centrally cleared markets, enablement mechanisms whereby existing members 
or participants of a trading venue can decide whether their trading interests may interact with 
a  new  participant’s  trading  interest  are  considered  discriminatory  and  an  attempt  to  limit 
competition.  Enablement  mechanisms  also  reduce  the  transparency  around  the  liquidity 
available on different trading venues. 
c)  Trading venues should not require minimum trading activity. 
Trading venues should not require minimum trading activity to become a member or participant 
of a trading venue, as this could restrict the access to the trading venue to large members or 
participants.  
d)  Trading  venues  should  not  impose  restrictions  on  the  number  of  participants  that  a 
participant can interact with. 
In a request for quote (RFQ) protocol, a trading venue should not impose limits on the number 
of participants that a firm can request a quote from. Whilst a firm requesting a quote may, in 
37 
 
 
 
 
compliance with Article 28 of MiFID II, want to limit the number of participants it requests quotes 
from in order to minimise the risk of unduly exposing its trading interest, which could result in 
it  obtaining a  worse  price, this should not be  mandated by the trading  venue. For  instance, 
where  a  smaller  firm  is  requesting  a  quote  to  execute  a  low  volume  trade,  it  might  be  less 
concerned about the risks of exposing its trading interest, and so happier to request quotes 
from a larger number of market makers or liquidity providers.  
Limiting the number of participants a firm can request quotes from risks restricting the ability 
of market participants to access liquidity pools, and only sending requests to traditionally larger 
dealers  who  they  assume  might  have  larger  inventories.  This  simultaneously  restricts  the 
ability of the requestor to access the best pool of liquidity and reduces the likelihood of a smaller 
dealer receiving requests, despite it having a strong trading interest. 
 
Question 4 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Can a person that is not authorised as an investment firm but meets the requirements of Article 
53(3) of MiFID II be a member or participant of a regulated market or an MTF? 
Answer 4 
Yes. Article 53(3) of MiFID II provides that an entity that is not an investment firm or a credit 
institution  can  be  a  member  of  a  regulated  market  under  certain  conditions,  this  rule  being 
extended to MTFs by Article 19(2) of MiFID II.  
ESMA  considers  that  this  provision  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  requirements  of 
Article 2(1). Under this provision, a person falling under any of the categories listed in Article 
2(1) would not have to be authorised as an investment firm.  
However, pursuant to Article 2(1)(d) (ii) of MiFID II, when a person dealing on own account in 
financial instruments other than commodity derivatives or emission allowances or derivatives 
thereof and not providing any other investment services or performing any other investment 
activities in such instruments is also a member of or a participant in a regulated market or an 
MTF,  it  falls  under  the  scope  of  MiFID  II,  and  should  accordingly  be  authorised  as  an 
investment firm unless: 
 
it is exempted under points (a), (i) and (j); or  
 
it is a non-financial entity which executes transactions on a trading venue which are 
objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activity or 
treasury financing activity of that non-financial entity or its group.  
As a consequence, the reference in Article 53(3) to persons other than investment firms and 
credit  institutions  only  relates  to  entities  that  are  exempted  from  authorisation  under  Article 
2(1), such as insurance companies or collective investment undertakings, as long as their own 
regulatory framework permits them to do so. 
38 
 
 
 
 
This Q&A does not address the issue of non-EEA firms being a member or participant of an 
EEA trading venue. 
 
Question 5 [Last update: 15/11/2017] 
Does a client relationship exist between two counterparties that trade on a trading venue? 
Answer 5 
No, there is no new client relationship between two counterparties to a trade that takes place 
on a trading venue, including when the trading venue operates on a request for quote basis. 
 
Question 6 [Last update: 28/03/2018] 
Can a trading venue control access to the fee and other information required to be published 
by Article 4 of RTS 10? 
Answer 6 
Article 4 of RTS 10 requires trading venues (regulated markets, MTFs and OTFs) to publish 
the objective criteria for the establishment of their fees and fee structures and other conditions 
provided for in Article 3, together with execution fees, ancillary fees, rebates, incentives and 
disincentives in one comprehensive and publicly accessible document on their website. 
ESMA  is  of  the  view  that  the  Article  requires  the  information  specified  to  be  contained  in  a 
single  document  and  available  to  any  member  of  the  public  with  no  further  dependence  on 
action  by  the  firm  operating  the  venue.  That  is,  the  document  should  be  immediately 
downloadable.  
Attempts to control public access, for example, by requiring an email to be sent requesting the 
document or an online form to be completed, would be considered not to meet the requirement. 
 
Question 7 [Last update: 04/10/2018] *new* 
Can  a  trading  venue use its trading systems  and platforms  to  arrange transactions that are 
then reported and ultimately executed on another trading venue? 
Answer 7 
No, the fundamental characteristic of a trading venue is to execute transactions.  
As defined under Article 4(1)(21), (22) and (23) of MiFID II, trading venues under all its possible 
forms  as  regulated  market,  multilateral  trading  facility  and  organised  trading  facility  are 
39 
 
 
 
 
multilateral systems “which bring together multiple third-party buying and selling interests in 
financial instruments […] in a way that results in a contract”. Therefore, a trading venue should 
not be allowed to arrange transactions without formalising the execution of those transactions 
under  its  rules  and  systems.  ESMA  has  also  already  clarified  that  a  transaction  cannot  be 
concluded on more than one trading venue at the same time. 
However, where a trading venue is operated by an investment firm, ESMA considers that these 
investment firms can arrange transactions as a provider of investment services listed under 
points (1), (2) or (3) in section A of Annex I of MiFID II, should the investment firm be authorised 
for the provision of such investment services. This is without prejudice to the guidance provided 
by ESMA in Q&A10 of section 5.2 clarifying the characteristics of an OTF and, more generally, 
what constitutes a multilateral activity and should be authorised as such. 
 
Question 8 [Last update: 04/10/2018] *new* 
Can a market operator or an investment firm operating an MTF apply for a single segment of 
the MTF to be registered as an SME growth market? 
Answer 8 
The operator of an MTF can apply for a segment of the MTF to be registered as an SME growth 
market when the requirements and criteria set out in Article 33 of MiFID II and Articles 77 and 
78 of the Commission Delegated Regulation 2017/565 are met in respect of that segment. A 
specific  segment  registered  as  an  SME  growth  market  should  be  considered  in  isolation  to 
other segments within the MTF. Other segments which are not specifically registered as an 
SME GM, cannot benefit from the SME growth market regime. For this purpose the following 
conditions should apply: 
  An SME growth market segment is clearly separated from the other market segments 
operated  by  the  MTF  operator.  Clear  separation  implies  at  least  a  different  name, 
rulebook, marketing strategy, and publicity as well as the allocation of the dedicated 
“Segment MIC” to the SME GM segment.  
  Trades made on a specific SME growth market segment should be clearly distinguished 
from other market activity within the other segments of the MTF. 
Furthermore, on demand of the competent authority and with the aim of avoiding circumvention 
of the definition of an SME growth market, the MTF should provide a comprehensive list of the 
instruments  listed  on  an  SME  growth  market  segment  and  provide  any  further  requested 
information on the operation of the SME growth market segment. 
 
Question 9 [Last update: 04/10/2018] *new* 
40 
 
 
 
 
Would  any  payment  received  from  a  trading  venue  in  respect  of  market  making  activity  or 
liquidity provision require the conclusion of a market making agreement? 
Answer 9 
No. The purpose of the requirement in Article 48 is to ensure that any party receiving financial 
incentives, such as rebates, to provide liquidity on a trading venue is subject to appropriate 
market  making  obligations,  but  these  need  not  always  take  the  form  of  a  market  making 
agreement as specified in RTS 8.  
A “rebate” in this context should be read to include negative fees or direct payments to the 
provider of liquidity as well as to refunds or discounts on fees due from the provider of liquidity 
to the trading venue. It follows from this interpretation that “maker/taker schemes”, whereby 
financial incentives are provided to market participants to conclude trades by posting passive 
orders, are not only allowed for firms required to enter into in a market making agreement in 
accordance with Article 17(4) of MiFID II but also for other market makers covered by Article 
4(1)(7) of MiFID II provided that these are subject to the appropriate market making obligations. 
 
5.2  Organised Trading Facilities (OTFs) 
 
Question 10 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
What are the characteristics of an OTF? When is the authorisation for the operation of an OTF 
required? 
Answer 10 
An OTF is a multilateral system, i.e. “a system or facility in which multiple third-party buying 
and selling interests in financial instruments are able to interact in the system” (Article 4(1)(19) 
of MIFID II). The OTF definition supplements this overarching definition by further establishing 
that  only  buying  and  selling  interests  in  bonds,  structured  finance  products,  emission 
allowances and derivatives may interact on an OTF in a way that results in a contract and that 
the execution of orders must be carried out on a discretionary basis. 
In addition, two types of systems operated by an OTF are identified in Article 20(6) of MiFID II: 
(i)  systems  that  cross  client  orders  (without  prejudice  to  the  restrictions  placed  on  matched 
principal trading) and (ii) systems that arrange transactions in non-equities where the operator 
of  the  OTF  may  facilitate  negotiations  between  clients  so  as  to  bring  together  two  or  more 
potentially compatible trading interests in a transaction. 
Under Section A(8) of Annex I of MiFID II, the operation of an OTF is an investment activity 
that requires prior authorisation.  
41 
 
 
 
 
ESMA  is  of  the  view  that  an  entity  should  seek authorisation  to  operate  an  OTF  where  the 
three following conditions are met: a) trading is conducted on a multilateral basis, b) the trading 
arrangements in place have the characteristics of a system, and c) the execution of the orders 
takes place on a discretionary basis through the systems or under the rules of the system.  
a)  Trading  is  conducted  on  a  multilateral  basis:  Interaction  with  a  view  to  trading  in  a 
financial instrument is conducted in such a way that a trading interest in the system can 
potentially interact with other opposite trading interests. As OTFs are required to “have 
at  least  three  materially  active  members  or  users,  each  having  the  opportunity  to 
interact with all the others in respect to price formation” (Article18(7) of MiFID II), an 
OTF  user’s  trading  interests  can  potentially  interact  with  those  of  at  least  two  other 
users. On OTFs, the interaction of user trading interest can take place in different ways, 
including through matched-principal trading or market-making, within the limits set out 
in Article 20(2) and 20(5). 
b)  The trading arrangements in place have the characteristics of a system: MiFIDII/MiFIR 
is technology neutral and accommodates a variety of “systems”. A system would be 
easily identified when embedded in an automated system. This would cover a situation 
where, for  instance,  the arrangements in place consist of  the  automated crossing of 
client trading interests, subject to the exercise of discretion on an OTF. However, other 
non-automated systems or repeatable arrangements that achieve a similar outcome as 
a computerised system, including for instance where a firm would reach out to other 
clients to find a potential match when receiving an initial buying or selling interest, would 
also be characterised as a system. 
Where  a  firm  would,  by  coincidence  and  accidentally,  receive  matching  buying  and 
selling  interests,  and  decide  to  execute  those  orders  internally,  such  unpredictable 
circumstances would not qualify as the operation of a system. 
c)  The execution of the transaction is taking place on the system or under the rules of the 
system. The execution of the orders would be considered to be taking place under the 
rules of the system including where, once the trade price, volume and terms have been 
agreed through a firm, the counterparties’ names are disclosed, the firm steps away 
from  the  transaction  and  the  transaction  is  then  legally  formalised  between  the 
counterparties outside a trading venue.  
If an investment firm arranges a transaction between two clients and the clients decide 
to formalise the trade on a regulated market or an MTF, the transaction would not be 
considered as taking place under the rules of the system because a transaction cannot 
be concluded on more than one venue. 
ESMA notes that if an investment firm were to arrange transactions on one system and 
provide  for  the  execution  of  the  transactions  on  another  system  for  avoidance 
purposes,  the  disconnection  between  arranging  and  executing  would  not  waive  the 
obligation for the investment firm operating those systems to seek authorisation as an 
OTF operator.  
42 
 
 
 
 
ESMA highlights that OTFs are only one of the three categories of multilateral trading systems 
foreseen by MiFID II. Market participants operating a platform that meets the characteristics of 
a  multilateral  trading  facility  should  therefore  exercise  judgment  to  assess,  based  on  their 
business  model,  whether  they  need  to  seek  authorisation  for  the  operation  of  a  multilateral 
trading facility (MTF), an OTF or, potentially of a regulated market. See also Question 5 on the 
differences between an MTF and an OTF and Questions 14 and 15 on systematic internalisers 
(SIs) and riskless transactions.  
 
Question 11 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Does the concept of OTF apply to voice trading and, if yes, when an investment firm executing 
transactions through voice negotiation should be considered as falling under the definition of 
OTF? 
Answer 11 
Yes. MiFID II is technology neutral and the OTF definition includes voice trading in the same 
way  as  the  definition  of  regulated  markets  and  MTFs  include  voice  trading  systems.  An 
investment  firm  executing  transactions  through  voice  negotiation  would  be  considered  as 
falling  under  the  definition  of  an  OTF  where  the  arrangements  in  place  would  meet  the 
conditions set out in Answer 3. 
 
Question 12 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
What distinguishes an OTF from an MTF?  
Answer 12 
MTFs and OTFs both are multilateral trading systems that can be operated by an investment 
firm or a market operator. However, compared to MTFs, OTFs have a number of key distinct 
features: 
a)  OTFs may only trade in bonds, structured finance products, derivatives and emission 
allowance (non-equity instruments); 
b)  There are less stringent limitations to the type of activities that the operator of the OTF 
may undertake both in relation to matched principal trading and trading on own account. 
Additional restrictions apply as an OTF and a SI cannot be operated by the same legal 
entity; 
c)  As opposed to regulated markets and MTFs governed by non-discretionary rules, the 
OTF operator must exercise discretion either when deciding to place or retract an order 
on the OTF and/or when deciding not to match potential matching orders available in 
the system;  
43 
 
 
 
 
d)  As opposed to regulated markets and MTFs that have members or participants, OTFs 
have clients. As a consequence, transactions concluded on OTFs have to comply with 
client  facing  rules,  including  best  execution  rules,  regardless  whether  the  OTF  is 
operated by an investment firms or a market operator; and 
e)  Wholesale energy products that must be physically settled (C6 REMIT) do not qualify 
as financial instruments when traded on an OTF. 
 
Question 13 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
The operator of an OTF may engage in dealing on own account other than matched-principal 
trading only with regard to sovereign debt instruments that do not have a liquid market. (Article 
20(3) of MiFID II. How should the liquidity of sovereign debt instruments be assessed?  
Answer 13 
ESMA notes that RTS 2 sets out how to determine whether a financial instrument has a liquid 
market. 
Although RTS 2 was developed for the sole purpose of further specifying the MiFIR pre-trade 
and  post-trade  transparency  obligations  for  trading  venues  and  investment  firms,  ESMA 
considers that the methodology and criteria set out in RTS 2 for assessing whether a sovereign 
bond has a liquid market are also relevant, and should serve as a reference, for the purpose 
of Article 20(3) of MiFID II. 
 
Question 14 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
On what  basis can  a  third  party investment firm carry out market  making  on  an  OTF  on  an 
independent basis (cf. Article 20(5) of MiFID II)? 
Answer 14 
As  provided  for  by  Article  20(5)  of  MiFID  II,  the  operator  of  the  OTF  may  engage  another 
investment  firm  to  carry  out  market  making  on  the  OTF  on  an  independent  basis.  The 
independence test is met when the investment firm carrying out market making has no close 
links with the operator of the OTF as defined under Article 4(1)(35) of MiFID II. 
ESMA recalls that, under Article 18(4) of MiFID II, an investment firm operating an OTF must 
have arrangements in place to clearly identify and manage the potential adverse consequence 
for the operation of the OTF and its users of any conflict of interest between the interest of the 
OTF,  the  investment  firm  operating  the  OTF  and  the  sound  functioning  of  the  OTF.  More 
generally,  ESMA  highlights  that  investment  firms  must  maintain  and  operate  effective 
organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps to 
prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interests of clients.  
44 
 
 
 
 
 
Question 15 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Can an SI and an OTF be operated by the same legal entity when they do not trade the same 
instruments or class of instruments (e.g. an SI in equities and an OTF in derivatives)? 
Answer 15 
No. ESMA is of the view that the very general wording of Article 20(4) of MiFID II introduces a 
blanket  prohibition  of  the  combination  of  the  OTF  and  SI  activities  by  the  same  legal  entity 
across asset classes and instruments. This blanket prohibition also addresses circumstances 
under which an investment firm would be operating an OTF and an SI in different asset classes, 
while being potentially subject to similar conflicts of interests as the ones associated with being 
an OTF and an SI in the same asset class or instrument. This would be the case, for instance, 
with  an  investment  firm  operating  an  OTF  in  equity  derivatives  while  being  an  SI  in  the 
underlying equities. 
 
Question 16 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Where an investment firm that is an SI has to set up a separate legal entity to operate an OTF 
(or vice-versa), can those two entities have shared resources?  
Answer 16 
Having two separate legal entities operating the OTF and the SI aims at ensuring that each 
venue is operated to the sole benefit of its respective clients and is not influenced in any way 
by the activity undertaken by the other venue. 
To that end, ESMA is of the view that the two legal entities respectively operating the SI and 
the OTF should have arrangements in place that prevent information sharing on each other’s 
relevant  activities  regarding  the  operation  of  the  OTF  and  the  SI.  This  would  include  for 
instance  having  distinct  management  and  operational  teams  and  physical  separation  of 
activities. Similarly, whereas some elements of the IT infrastructure could be shared, execution 
systems would be expected to be segregated and safeguards in place to ensure that there is 
no information leakage across the SI and the OTF activities. Outsourcing from one legal entity 
to the other should only be considered where the arrangements in place meet a similar test. 
The above is without prejudice to the MiFID II provisions on identification and management of 
conflicts of interest to be met by each of the two investment firms. 
 
Question 17 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
45 
 
 
 
 
Under which conditions can an OTF connect to other liquidity pools such as an SI or another 
OTF? 
Answer 17 
Article 20(4) of MiFID II limits the circumstances under which an OTF may connect with other 
liquidity pools by prohibiting orders placed in an OTF to interact with quotes or orders in a SI 
or with orders in other OTFs. Interaction would occur when buying and selling interests would 
comingle in the same liquidity pool. Accordingly, an SI quote may not be placed on an OTF. 
Nor can an order originating from another OTF. 
ESMA highlights that a trading interest in an OTF may not be executed against an opposite 
order or quote on another execution venue. For a transaction to take place, the two opposite 
trading  interests  must  be  placed  with  the  same  execution  venue.  However,  this  does  not 
prevent the investment firm or the market operator operating an OTF from retracting the order 
from the OTF and sending it to another OTF, to an SI, an MTF or a regulated market, where 
consistent with the investment firm’s or the market operator’s execution policy and exercise of 
discretion.  
 
Question 18 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
When an investment firm operates an OTF, at which level should the best execution policy be 
set?  At  the  level  of  the  investment  firm,  at  the  level  of  the  OTF  or  both?  Would  similar 
requirements apply to a market operator operating an OTF?  
Answer 18 
Where an investment firm operates an OTF, ESMA is of the view that the investment firm’s 
best execution should cover how orders are executed both at the level of the investment firm 
and at the level of the OTF and, in particular, how discretion is exercised at each stage. 
Firstly, an investment firm operating an OTF should, in the same way as other investment firms 
that execute client orders, have a firm-level execution policy setting out the various execution 
venues,  including  its  own  OTF,  that  it  will  be  considering  when  receiving  a  client  order  and 
explain in which circumstances an execution venue would prevail over the others.  
Secondly, the investment firm should have either a separate policy or an additional section in 
the firm-level execution policy governing how, when a client order is sent to the OTF, the best 
possible result for the client is achieved taking into account the trading interests in the system 
and  the  different  execution  mechanisms  that  may  be  available  on  the  OTF,  such  as  voice 
execution, electronic RFQ or order book. 
As  the exercise  of discretion  by the investment firm in its OTF operator capacity is to  be  in 
compliance with its execution policy, the document should also set out in details the area(s) in 
which the OTF operator intends to exercise discretion and the basis on which such discretion 
will be exercised (Article 20(6) of MiFID II). 
46 
 
 
 
 
Equivalent requirements apply to a market operator operating an OTF. In this regard, a market 
operator would need to have a best execution policy in place, setting out the conditions under 
which an order received by a client may be executed on its OTF, as described above. 
 
Question 19 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Does the exercise of any form of discretion mean that a venue is an OTF?  
Answer 19 
No. Article 20(6) of MiFID II sets out that “the market operator or the investment firm operating 
an OTF must exercise discretion only in either or both of the following circumstances: 
a)  When deciding to place or retract an order on the OTF they operate; 
b)  When deciding not to match a specific client order with other orders available in the 
systems at a given time, provided it is in compliance with specific instructions received 
from a client and with its obligations in accordance with article 27.  
For the system that crosses client orders, the investment firm or the market operator operating 
the OTF may decide if, when, and how much of two or more orders it wants to match within 
the  system.  […]  with  regards  to  a  system  that  arranges  transactions  in  non-equities,  the 
investment  firm  or  market  operator  operating  the  OTF  may  facilitate  negotiations  between 
clients  so  as  to  bring  together  two  or  more  potentially  compatible  trading  interest  in  a 
transaction”. 
ESMA  understands  “execution  on  a  discretionary  basis”  and  “exercise  of  a  discretion”  as 
meaning  that,  in  the  circumstances  foreseen  in  Article  20(6),  the  operator  of  the  OTF  has 
options to consider for the execution of a client’s order and exercises a judgement as to the 
decision to make and the way forward. 
As suggested by Article 20(6), ESMA is of the view that the exercise of discretion can usefully 
be split into a) order discretion and b) execution discretion. 
c)  Exercise of discretion at order level   
When  an  investment  firm  or  a  market  operator  receives  an  order  from  a  client,  the  “order 
discretion” refers to the judgement exercised by the OTF operator whether to place the order 
at all on the OTF, whether to place the whole order or just a portion of it on the OTF, and when 
to  do  so. This  may be  the  case for  instance  where  an  investment  firm  would  receive a  buy 
order  for  a  500  lots  and  would  decide  to  place  an  order  for  200  lots  only  on  the  OTF,  the 
remaining 300 lots being executed elsewhere. 
Similarly, and as opposed to the operator of an MTF which may not withdraw an order from 
the MTF at its own initiative unless for fair and orderly market purposes, the operator of the 
47 
 
 
 
 
OTF is expected to make a judgement as to whether and when an order should be retracted 
from the OTF.  
This may be the case where, at a given point of time, the OTF operator considers that a more 
favourable  outcome  would  be  obtained  by  executing  the  order  on  another  execution  venue 
foreseen in the best execution policy. The OTF operator may also have placed the order on 
the OTF, sent it to another trading venue simultaneously, subsequently decided to have the 
order executed on the trading venue and retracted it from the OTF. 
The exercise of  order  discretion would  always have  to  comply with the OTF best execution 
policy  and  with  client  order  handling  rules.  Where  clients  would  be  providing  a  specific 
instruction to the operator of the OTF, the OTF operator would not be considered as exercising 
order discretion when complying with that specific instruction. 
d)  Exercise of discretion at execution level 
Under Article 20(6), the exercise of discretion at execution level has to be in compliance with 
client specific instructions and the best execution policy. ESMA is of the view that the mere 
implementation of client specific instructions or of best execution obligations would not be the 
exercise of discretion. 
The operator of the OTF is expected to exercise a judgement as to if, when, and how much of 
two  matching  orders  in  the  system  should  be  matched.  For  instance,  assuming  a  buy  side 
order for 500 bonds and an opposite order of 200 bonds have been placed into the OTF, the 
operator of the OTF would exercise discretion when deciding whether the 500 buy side order 
should not be matched with the sell side order.  
Finally, ESMA highlights that the exercise of discretion, be it “order discretion” or “execution 
discretion”, should  not be  just a  possibility foreseen  in the rules of the OTF and in the best 
execution  policy  of  the  OTF  operator.  Discretion  has  to  be  actually  implemented  by  the 
operator of the OTF as part of its ordinary course of business and should be a key part of its 
activities. It is not expected that any quantitative threshold would be set to assess the exercise 
of  discretion.  However,  as  provided  for  under  Article  20(7)  of  MiFID  II,  at  the  time  of 
authorisation or on ad-hoc basis, the market operator or the investment firm operating an OTF 
should  be  able  to  provide  to  its  national  competent  authority  a  detailed  description  of  how 
discretion will be exercised and in particular when an order may be retracted from the OTF and 
when and how two or more client orders will be matched in the OTF. ESMA also highlights that 
the OTF operator should be able to explain to its national competent authority the rationale 
underpinning the exercise of discretion, such as the set of reasons and the logical basis for not 
matching two opposite buying and selling interests. Random placing, retracting, matching or 
non-matching of orders on the OTF would not be considered as the exercise of discretion. 
Likewise,  the  exercise  of  pre-trade  controls  by  the  operator  of  the  OTF  to  ensure  fair  and 
orderly  trading  would  not  qualify  as  the  exercise  of  discretion.  Post-trade  decisions,  for 
example over where transactions are settled, are not relevant either for the purposes of these 
provisions.  Similarly,  the  decision  to  enter  into  a  client  relationship  in  compliance  with  OTF 
rules on non-discriminatory access does not constitute discretion under Article 20(6).

Question 20 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Does discretion have to be exercised on an order by order basis?  
Answer 20 
ESMA  is  of  the  view  that  discretion  at  order  level  (see  Answer  12)  does  not  have  to  be 
exercised order by order. As an example, the OTF operator may consider, at a given point in 
time that some or all orders of a specific size in a specific instrument should be retracted from 
the OTF as more favourable conditions are temporarily available elsewhere. However, the OTF 
operator must have the ability to exercise discretion at order level if circumstances so require, 
for instance in case of prior execution of an order on another trading venue. 
Conversely, ESMA is of the view that, at execution level, discretion whether not to match two 
potential  matching  buying  and  selling  interests  can  only  be  meaningfully  exercised  at  order 
level.  
 
Question 21 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Does  a  fully  automated  system  exclude  the  exercise  of  discretion  and  should  therefore  be 
automatically classified as an MTF? 
Answer 21 
No. MiFID II is ‘technology neutral’ and permits any trading protocol to be operated by an OTF, 
provided it is consistent with fair and orderly trading and the exercise of discretion. 
ESMA is of the view that the exercise of discretion as to if and when to place or retract an order 
could possibly be automated through artificial intelligence and algorithms, without necessarily 
the exercise of human judgement on a case by case basis. Conversely, human intervention is 
not  necessarily  sufficient  to  prove  the  exercise  of  discretion.  Human  intervention  that  is  not 
based on the exercise of human judgement (for instance, only consisting in the random placing 
or retracting or matching/non-matching of orders) would not be considered as the exercise of 
discretion.  
When discretion is exercised at execution level, i.e. when deciding if, when or how much of 
two or more trading interests should (or should not) be matched, ESMA is of the view that the 
exercise of discretion would not preclude the use of automated systems, provided that certain 
conditions are met. In particular, the sophisticated algorithms supporting automated matching 
would  need  to  anticipate  the  circumstances  under  which  the  orders  would  not  be  matched; 
they would also have the capacity to ensure that the decision to match (or not to match) two 
opposite trading interests is in compliance with the best execution policy or a client specific 
instruction. As one of the differentiating factors from execution algorithms operated by MTFs, 
49 
 
 
 
 
the algorithms operated by the OTF would be expected to take into account external market 
factors or other external source of information to demonstrate the exercise of discretion. 
 
Question 22 [Last update: 03/10/2017] 
Can an OTF offer trading in C(6) REMIT wholesale energy products only? 
Answer 22 
No.  Under  Article  4(1)(23)  of  MiFID  II,  an  organised  trading  facility  (OTF)  is  a  multilateral 
trading  system  which  organises  the  interaction  of  multiple  third  party  buying  and  selling 
interests  in bonds,  structured  finance  products,  emission  allowances  and  derivatives,  i.e.  in 
financial instruments. 
Accordingly, to be authorised as an OTF, a multilateral trading system must offer trading in the 
financial instruments listed above, without prejudice to the other requirements to be met for 
such authorisation.  
However,  a  trading  platform  that  is  authorised  as  an  OTF  based  on  trading  financial 
instruments can, in addition, offer trading in wholesale energy contracts that must be physically 
settled ( “REMIT carve-out” contracts).  
ESMA highlights that the OTF must ensure that genuine trading in financial instruments takes 
place on the OTF to be authorised, and retain authorisation, as an OTF, with appropriate staff, 
IT, financial and other resources being devoted to this activity. Trading in financial instruments 
should not be designed for the sole purpose of obtaining an OTF license and with the end-
objective of trading REMIT carve-out contracts almost exclusively. 
 
Question 23 [Last update: 03/10/2017] 
When an OTF authorised to trade financial instruments also trades REMIT wholesale energy 
products, i.e. in non-financial instruments, what are the applicable MiFID II/MiFIR provisions? 
Answer 23 
MiFID II/MiFIR provisions apply to the operation of an OTF trading financial instruments. 
Where a person seeks authorisation as an OTF and intends to offer trading in REMIT carve-
out contracts as well, a detailed description of the REMIT carve-out trading activity should be 
included in the authorisation file so that the competent authority can understand and assess 
the  potential  impact  of  REMIT  carve-out  trading  on  the  investment  firm  or  market  operator 
50 
 
 
 
 
operating the OTF and on trading in financial instruments. The information to be provided is 
set out in ITS 1916. 
Where  an  investment  firm  or  market  operator  operating  an  OTF  has  been  authorised  and 
intends to additionally offer trading in REMIT carve-out products, a detailed description of the 
REMIT carve-out trading activity should be provided to the competent authority in due course 
before the start of such trading activities. 
The management body of the investment firm (or the market operator) operating the OTF is 
responsible  for  defining,  approving  and  overseeing  the  organisation  of  the  firm  or  market 
operator for the provision of investment services and activities, taking into account the nature, 
scale  and  complexity  of  its  business  and  all  the  requirements  the  firm  has  to  comply  with. 
ESMA  is  of  the  view  that  the  responsibilities  of  the  management  body  extends  to  the  non-
financial instrument trading activity of the OTF as they may have an impact on the investment 
activities  provided  by  the  investment  firm  (or  the  market  operator).  This  also  applies  to  the 
management  body’s  responsibilities  governing  the  investment  firm  (or  market  operator)’s 
internal policy setting out, among other things, the activities, products and operations offered 
or provided in accordance with risk tolerance of the firm (or the market operator). 
More generally, ESMA highlights that a market operator or an investment firm operating an 
OTF trading both financial instruments and  REMIT carve-out  products should identify, prevent 
or  otherwise  manage  any  potential  adverse  consequences  that  trading  in  REMIT  carve-out  
products  may  have  on  trading  in  financial  instruments  and  on  its  ability  to  meet  its 
MiFIDII/MiFIR obligations on an on-going basis. Upon request, the operator of the OTF should 
be able to explain to the competent authority the procedures and arrangements put in place to 
that effect. 
 
Question 24 [Last update: 03/10/2017] 
How do the OTF best execution obligations apply when third-party brokers are clients of the 
OTF or  when  these brokers provide Direct Electronic Access  (DEA) (see  Article 4(1)(41) of 
MiFID II)? 
Answer 24 
When an investment firm or a market operator operating an OTF receives orders or indications 
of interest from a broker acting on behalf of its own clients, the operator of the OTF should be 
implementing its own best execution policy when executing the order from the broker orders 
as it owes its user clients (the broker) the duty of best execution. The broker should determine 
that the OTF it selects allows it to comply with its best execution obligations towards its own 
                                                 
16 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/824 of 25 May 2016 laying down implementing technical standards with regard 
to the content and format of the description of the functioning of multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities and 
the notification to the European Securities and Markets Authority according to Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament 
and of the Council on markets in financial instruments (OJ L 137, 26.5.2016, p. 10–16) 
51 
 
 
 
 
clients. To that end, the broker should conduct a performance assessment of the OTF including 
how discretion is exercised. 
In the specific case of DEA to an OTF, the DEA order is entered in the OTF client’s name (the 
broker) and the OTF operator should execute the DEA order as it would for any OTF client 
order. Alternatively, the operator of the OTF may decide not to permit DEA to its system. 
ESMA notes that a DEA order could be considered as a client specific instruction to the broker 
providing the DEA arrangement to its clients. 
 
Question 25 [Last update: 29/05/2018] 
Can an OTF arrange or trade strategies including an equity leg? 
Answer 25 
Strategies that include futures contracts, the contingent trade of a basket of equities or delta 
one financial instruments can be arranged by an investment firm, as a provider of investment 
services listed under points (1), (2) or (3) in section A of Annex I of MiFID II. This includes a 
strategy in which one party agrees to buy an equity and to execute a short derivative in the 
equity and the other party agrees to sell the equity and to execute the long derivative. 
ESMA  considers  that  an  investment  firm  operating  an  OTF  could  arrange  such  strategies 
provided that the equity leg is not executed on the OTF system, since Article 4(1)(23) of MiFID 
II defines OTFs as multilateral systems where only non-equity instruments can be traded. This 
restriction also applies to strategies composed of a look-alike equity leg, including a forward 
trade. 
In addition, for the purpose of market integrity, ESMA recalls that double counting should be 
avoided.  Thus,  an  OTF  should  only  provide  transparency  information,  transaction  and  best 
execution reports for transactions that are concluded on its system and considered as taking 
place under the rules of its system. In case of a strategy composed of an equity leg concluded 
on another venue while the derivative is concluded on the OTF system, the OTF is subject to 
reporting requirements for the derivatives’ leg. 
 
5.3  Systematic internalisers  
 
Question 26 [Last update: 28/03/2018] 
52 
 
 
 
 
Recital  19  of  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/565  clarifies  the  conditions 
under which an SI may engage in matched principal trading to execute client orders. To what 
extent can SIs engage in other types of riskless back-to-back transactions? 
Answer 26 
Recital 19 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 is not limited to internal 
matching of client orders through matched principal trading but more generally prevents SIs 
from operating any system that would “bring together third party buying and selling interests in 
functionally the same way as a trading venue”. The prohibition for an SI to operate an internal 
matching  system  for  matching  client  orders  is  just  one  example,  as  opposed  to  the  unique 
circumstance, under which an SI would actually be operating functionally in the same way as 
a trading venue and would be required to seek authorisation as such. 
Based on the SI definition provided in Article 4(1)(20) of MiFID II, ESMA understands that the 
trading activity of a SI is characterised by risk-facing transactions that impact the Profit and 
Loss  account  of  the  firm.  By  undertaking  such  risk-facing  transactions,  SIs  are  a  valuable 
source of liquidity to market participants. In that regard, ESMA notes that the MiFIR pre-trade 
transparency  provisions  for  SIs  seek  to  avoid  submitting  SI  to  undue  risks  based  on  the 
assumption and understanding that SIs are indeed facing risks when trading.  
In contrast to the above, ESMA is of the view that arrangements operated by an SI would be 
functionally similar to a trading venue where they meet the following criteria: 
a)  The arrangements would extend beyond a bilateral interaction between the SI and a 
client,  with  a  view  to  ensuring  that  the  SI  de  facto  does  not  undertake  risk-facing 
transactions. This would be the case, for instance, where an SI would have agreements 
with other liquidity providers so that the SI would do a riskless back-to back transaction 
with one of those liquidity providers whenever a transaction is executed with a client, 
or where it would only execute one transaction contingent on another one. A similar 
outcome  would  be  reached  from  the  reverse  situation  where  one  or  more  liquidity 
providers would be streaming quotes to an SI. The quotes would then be forwarded by 
the  SI  to  its  clients  to  be  executed  against,  resulting  again  in  no  risk  back-to-back 
transactions which could involve multiple parties. The concept of de facto riskless back-
to-back  transactions  is  not  confined  to  pairs  of  transactions  in  the  same  financial 
instrument. Other arrangements, for example where one leg is a securities transaction 
and the other is a derivative which references that security, could also be deemed as 
having  the  objective  or  consequence  of  carrying  out  de  facto  riskless  back-to-back 
transactions. 
By crossing client trading interests with other liquidity providers’ quotes, via matched 
principal  trading  or  another  type  of  riskless  back-to-back  transaction,  so  that  it  is  de 
facto not trading on risk, the SI would actually organise an interaction between its client 
orders on the one hand and the SI or other liquidity providers’ quotes on the other hand. 
The  SI  would  be  bringing  together  multiple  third  party  buying  and  selling  trading 
interests in a way functionally similar to the operator of a trading venue. 
53 
 
 
 
 
b)  The  arrangements  in  place  are  used  on  a  regular  basis  and  qualify  as  a  system  or 
facility, as opposed to ad-hoc transactions. The existence of a system would be easily 
identified  where,  for  instance,  the  arrangement  in  place  would  be  underpinned  by 
technological  developments  to  increase  speed  and  efficiency  and  legal  agreements 
would be in place between the SI and liquidity providers. The operation of a system 
could  also  include  circumstances  where  there  is  an  understanding  with  third  parties 
that trade by trade hedging will be available on a regular basis. ESMA recalls that MiFID 
II/MiFIR is technology neutral and applies to voice systems as well as to electronic and 
hybrid systems; 
c)  The transactions arising from bringing together multiple third party buying and selling 
interests are executed OTC, outside the rules of a trading venue.  
ESMA highlights that the above does not prevent SIs from hedging the positions arising from 
the execution of client orders as long as it does not lead to the SI de facto executing non risk-
facing  transactions  and  bringing  together  multiple  third  party  buying  and  selling  interests. 
ESMA is of the view that an SI would not be bringing together multiple third party buying and 
selling interests as foreseen in Recital 19 where hedging transactions would be executed on a 
trading venue. 
 
Question 27 [Last update: 03/04/2017] 
Recital (19) of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 foresees that a SI can 
undertake matched principal trading provided it does so on an occasional, and not a regular, 
basis. How is “occasional basis” expected to be assessed?  
Answer 27 
As  stated  under  Answer  15,  ESMA  is  of  the  view  that  a  SI  activity  is  characterised  by  risk-
facing transactions that impact the Profit and Loss account of the firm. 
Where an SI would receive, and execute, two potentially matching buying and selling interests 
from clients as one matched principal trade or where it would try to find the buyer for a sell 
order (or the other way around) and execute the first leg contingent on the second leg, those 
transactions would not qualify as risk facing transactions. As such, they could only be executed 
by an SI on an occasional basis, as provided for by Recital (19) of the Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2017/565. 
ESMA  is  of  the  view  that  an  SI  would  not  be  undertaking  matched  principal  trading  on  an 
occasional and non-regular basis if it meets any of the following criteria:  
a)  the investment firm operates one or more systems or arrangements, be they automated 
or not, intended to match opposite client orders. The investment firm may accidentally 
receive  two  opposite  matching  buying  and  selling  interests  and  match  them  but  it 
54 
 
 
 
 
should  not  have  systems  in  place  aimed  at  increasing  opportunities  for  client  order 
matching; 
b)  when  executing  client  orders,  non-risk  facing  activities  account  for  a  recurrent  or 
significant source of revenue for the investment firm’s trading activity; 
c)  the  investment  firm  markets,  or  otherwise  promotes,  its  matched  principal  trading 
activities. 
 
Question 28 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Should a system providing quote streaming and order execution services to multiple SIs be 
authorised as a multilateral system? 
Answer 28 
Articles  14(1)  and  18(1)  of  MIFIR  require  SIs  to  make  public  firm  quotes,  which  may  be 
published through an APA. Some prospective APAs propose setting up arrangements which, 
on top of their APA services, provide a suite of quote streaming and order execution services 
to SIs and their clients. Clients cannot interact with more than one SI via a single message but 
can send multiple messages to multiple SIs participating in the service provided. 
Article 4(19) of MiFID II defines a multilateral system as” […] any system or facility in which 
multiple  third-party  buying  and  selling  trading  interests  in  financial  instruments  are  able  to 
interact in the system”. Article 1(7) of MiFID II requires all multilateral systems to operate as 
either a RM, an MTF or an OTF. 
In  line  with  the  criteria  set  out  in  Q&A  3  on  OTFs  published  on  3  April  2017  for  identifying 
multilateral trading systems, ESMA notes that: 
a)  If a system allows multiple SIs to send quotes to multiple clients and allows clients to 
request execution against multiple SIs, then this meets the interaction test foreseen in 
Article 4(1)(19) even if there is no aggregation across individual SI quote streams; 
b)  The arrangements described above have the characteristics of a system as they are 
embedded in an automated facility; and, 
c)  Those  arrangements  are  not  limited  to  pooling  potential  buying  and  selling  interests 
from SIs but also cater for the direct execution of the selected SI quotes. Genuine trade 
execution would be taking place on the system provided. 
Accordingly, a system that provides quote streaming and order execution services for multiple 
SIs should be considered a multilateral system and would be required to seek authorisation as 
a regulated market, MTF or OTF in accordance with Article 1(7) of MiFID II. 
55 
 
 
 
 
ESMA reminds that if a firm were to arrange transactions on one system and provide for the 
execution  of  the  transactions  on  another  system,  the  disconnection  between  arranging  and 
executing  would  not  waive  the  obligation  for  the  firm  operating  those  systems  to  seek 
authorisation as a trading venue.   
 
Question 29 [Last update: 03/10/2017] 
Article 15(2) of MiFIR sets out that “in justified cases”, systematic internalisers may execute 
orders at a better price than the quoted prices provided that the price falls within a public range 
close to market conditions. What are those justified cases? 
Answer 29 
Articles 14, 15, and 17 of MiFIR establish a comprehensive pre-trade transparency framework 
for systematic internalisers (SIs) in shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other 
similar financial instruments. As set out in Article 17(3) of MiFIR, the implementing measures 
further  aim  at  ensuring  the  efficient  valuation  of  those  instruments  and  maximising  the 
possibility for investment firms to obtain the best deal for their clients. 
Whilst  Article  15(2)  of  MiFIR  provides  that  in  justified  cases,  systematic  internalisers  may 
execute  orders  at  a  better  price  than  the  quote  published,  ESMA  considers  that  price 
improvements on those quotes are only justified where they would serve similar purposes as 
those referred on Article 17(3) of MiFIR.  
ESMA notes that marginal price improvements on quoted prices would challenge the efficient 
valuation  of  equity  instruments  without  bringing  any  real  benefits  to  investors.  As  a 
consequence, and to ensure that price improvements do not undermine the efficient pricing of 
instruments traded, price improvements  on  quoted  prices would  only be justified  when they 
are meaningful and reflect the minimum tick size applicable to the same financial instrument 
traded on a trading venue.  
This is without prejudice to SIs’ ability to quote any price level when dealing in sizes above 
standard market size.

6  Access  to  CCPs  and  trading  venues  [Last  update: 
12/09/2017] 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
When should CCPs notify the transitional arrangements foreseen in Article 35(5) of MiFIR? 
Answer 1 
Article  35(5)  of  MiFIR  does  not  establish  any  timing  other  than  indicating  that  CCPs  must 
submit  their  notification  before  the  application  of  MiFIR.  However,  given  the  amount  of 
arrangements necessary for the transition to MiFID II/MiFIR and the risk of ‘bottlenecks’, ESMA 
encourages  CCPs  that  meet  the  requirements  set  out  in  Article  35(5)  of  MiFIR  and  are 
considering applying for the transitional arrangements to do so as early as possible during the 
course  of  2017.  In  any  case,  ESMA  recommends  that  CCPs  should  notify  their  intention  to 
make use of the temporary opt-out under Article 35(5) of MiFIR no later than 30 September 
2017. 
 
Question 2 [Last update: 07/07/2017] 
Is a CCP using an open offer trade acceptance model obliged to accept a request for access 
from a trading venue using a novation trade acceptance model? 
Answer 2 
Yes, a CCP using an open offer trade acceptance model that receives a request for access 
from a trading venue using a novation trade acceptance model should grant that access unless 
it  can  identify  how  precisely  the  simultaneous  use  of  an  open  offer  and  a  novation  trade 
acceptance model would give rise to significant undue risks that cannot be managed. 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 12/09/2017] 
According to Article 36(5) of MiFIR trading venues in ETDs that fall below the threshold of the 
annual notional amount traded of EUR 1 000 000 million have to notify ESMA and their NCAs 
if they intend to temporarily opt-out of the provisions of that Article (and the access provisions 
in general). When and how should trading venues submit their notification to ESMA and their 
NCA? 
Answer 3 
57 
 
 
 
 
Trading venues should notify their intention to temporarily opt-out of the access provisions to 
ESMA at the very latest by the end of September 2017 according to the requirements set out 
in  in  Articles  17  and  19  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2017/581  on  access  in 
respect of central counterparties and trading venues (RTS 15).  
In order to allow for a quick and timely processing of notifications received, ESMA recommends 
that  trading  venues  wishing  to  benefit  from  the  temporary  opt-out  should  first  notify  their 
national competent authority as soon as the necessary trading data for 2017 as specified in 
Article 19(2) of RTS 15 is available together with any other documents and evidence supporting 
that their annual notional amount traded will be below EUR 1,000,000 million in 2017.  
Once their NCA has verified the completeness of the documents provided and the calculation 
of the annual notional amount traded, trading venues should submit their notification in written 
form using the forms 3.1 and 3.2 of the Annex of RTS 15 to ESMA.  Under the ‘relevant contact 
details’  in  form  3.1  the  trading  venue  should  provide  as  well  an  email  address  and  phone 
number for  further requests/notifications  from ESMA. In  form 3.2 the trading  venues should 
break down the notional amount traded in ETDs in 2017per asset class as defined in Annex II 
of RTS 2. Furthermore, where the trading venue is part of a group which is connected by close 
links, the information in form 3.2 should include the annual amount traded on all the trading 
venues within the same group that are based in the Union. 
ESMA will inform the trading venues notifying the temporary opt-out of its assessment at the 
latest three months after reception of a complete notification. Furthermore, ESMA will publish 
the list of notifications received. 
 
Question 4 [Last update: 12/09/2017] 
In which cases should a trading venue apply for an exemption foreseen in Articles 36(5) or 
Article 54(2) of MiFIR? 
Answer 4 
MiFIR provides for two transitory arrangements with respect to ETDs, in case the European 
Commission decides not to temporarily exclude ETDs from the scope of Articles 35 and 36 of 
MiFIR in accordance with Article 52(12) of MiFIR:   
a)  Article 54(2) of MiFIR allows for trading venues to apply to their NCAs for transitional 
arrangements  on  the  basis  of  the  risks  that  granting  access  to  the  venue  on  ETDs 
would  pose  to  the  orderly  functioning  of  the  relevant  trading  venue.  Their  NCA  may 
exempt ETDs traded on that venue from the access provisions for only one transitional 
period of 30 months that cannot be prolonged. This provision applies to CCPs as well.  
b)  Article 36(5) of MiFIR specifies that trading venues offering trading in ETDs may opt 
out of the access provisions for a thirty-month period provided that their annual notional 
amount traded in ETDs falls below EUR 1,000,000 million. This transitory arrangement 
58 
 
 
 
 
can be prolonged as long as the annual notional amount traded on that venue remains 
below the above-mentioned threshold all along the observation period, irrespective of 
any  other  consideration.  ESMA  is  in  charge  of  approving  the  opt-out  based  on  the 
analysis of the annual notional amount traded. 
 
Question 5 [Last update: 12/09/2017] 
When  should  a  CCP  or  a  trading  venue  apply  for  permission  to  avail  itself  of  transitional 
arrangements under Article 54(2) of MiFIR? 
Answer 5 
Article 54(2) of MiFIR does not establish any timing other than indicating that CCPs and trading 
venues must submit the application before the entry into force of MiFIR.  
Following the Commission decision not to exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope 
of  Articles  35  and  36  MiFIR,  CCPs  and  trading  venues  considering  applying  for  transitional 
arrangements under Article 54(2) of MiFIR should submit their applications to NCA no later 
than by the end of September 2017 in order to ensure the timely processing of their application 
before MiFIR applies. 
 
Question 6 [Last update: 12/09/2017] 
In  case  that  a  trading  venue  which  opted-out  the  access  provisions  for  ETDs  under  Article 
36(5) MiFIR maintains close links with a CCP, is that CCP prevented from having access rights 
to venues trading any ETD? 
Answer 6 
CCPs with close links to trading venues that benefit from the exemption under Article 36(5) of 
MiFIR have their access rights restrained to exchange-traded derivatives ‘within the relevant 
threshold’. The ‘relevant threshold’ refers to the notional amount traded in all ETDs concluded 
under the rules of that venue.  
ESMA considers that this limitation applies to derivatives falling within the same asset class of 
the ETDs traded on that trading venue as described in Annex II of RTS 2, consistently with the 
notification requirements in Forms 3.2 and 4.2 in RTS 15.

7  Application  of  MiFID  II  after  3  January  2018,  including 
issues of ‘late transposition’ [Last update: 18/12/2017] 
 
Question 1 [Last update: 18/12/2017] 
Should authorisations as a regulated market granted under MiFID I still be valid after 3 January 
2018? 
Answer 1 
Yes, the authorisations granted under MiFID I should continue to be valid after 3 January 2018. 
This  applies  also  to  the  authorisations  for  market  operators  to  operate  an  MTF.  However, 
ESMA notes that competent authorities, as set out in Article 44 of MiFID II (and, already, Article 
36 of MiFID I), should monitor that market operators comply at all times with the conditions for 
initial authorisation and therefore regularly review conditions for initial authorisation. 
 
Question 2 [Last update: 18/12/2017] 
Can regulated markets established in Member States that have not transposed MiFID II at the 
date  of  3  January  2018,  and  that  already  have  a  valid  authorisation,  continue  to  provide 
appropriate arrangements in other EU Member States that facilitate access to and trading on 
those markets by remote members and participants after the entry into application of MiFID II? 
Answer 2 
Regulated  markets  established  in  Member  States  that  have  not  transposed  MiFID  II  by  3 
January 2018 but that have already been authorised under MiFID I and have already provided 
appropriate  arrangements  that  facilitate  access  to  and  trading  on  those  markets  by  remote 
members  and  participants  in  other  Member  States,  may  continue  to  provide  these 
arrangements in those Member States. The competent authorities of regulated markets that 
provide  such  arrangements  on  the  territory  of  other  Member  States  may  be  requested  to 
reassure  host  Member  States  competent  authorities  that,  pending  transposition  of  MiFID  II, 
they are applying the detailed operating conditions included in MiFID II. 
 
Question 3 [Last update: 18/12/2017] 
Can  entities  providing  data  reporting  services  established  in  a  Member  State  that  has  not 
transposed MiFID II, provide data reporting services throughout the Union? 
Answer 3 
60 
 
 
 
 
According to Article 60 of MiFID II authorisations for the provisions of data reporting services 
are  valid  for  the  entire  Union  and  allow  a  data  reporting  services  provider  to  provide  the 
services, for which it has been authorised, throughout the Union. Therefore, only authorised 
entities in Member States that have transposed the relevant provisions of MiFID II can provide 
data reporting services throughout the Union.
