Different categories of low carbon

indices with various degrees of ambition 
have emerged in the marketplace. While 
some benchmarks aim to lower the carbon 
footprint of a standard investment 
portfolio, others aim to select only 
components that contribute to attaining the 
2°C degree objective set out in the Paris 
Climate Agreement. Despite differences in 
objectives and strategies, all of these 
benchmarks are commonly promoted as 
low-carbon benchmarks.

(14)  Each company whose assets are 
selected as underlying in a positive impact 
benchmark should save more carbon 
emissions than it produces, hence have a 
positive impact on the environment. The 
asset and portfolio managers who claim to 
pursue an investment strategy compatible 
with the Paris Climate Agreement should 
therefore use positive carbon impact 
benchmarks.

(15)  A variety of benchmark 
administrators claim that their benchmarks 
pursue environmental, social and 
governance (‘ESG’) objectives. The users 
of those benchmarks do however not 
always have the necessary information on 
the extent to which the methodology of 
those benchmark administrators takes into 
account those ESG objectives. The existing 
information is also often scattered and does 
not allow for effective comparison for 
investment purposes across borders. To 
enable market players to make well-
informed choices, benchmark 
administrators should be required to 
disclose how their methodology takes into 
account the ESG factors for each 
benchmark or family of benchmarks that is 
promoted as pursuing ESG objectives. 
That information should also be disclosed 
in the benchmark statement. The 
administrators of benchmarks that do not 
promote or take into account the ESG 
objectives, should not be subject to this 
disclosure obligation.

were selected and weighted and which 
assets were excluded and for what reason. 
The benchmark administrators should also 
specify how the low carbon benchmarks 
differ from the underlying parent index, 
notably in terms of the applicable weights, 
market capitalisation and financial 
performance of the underlying assets. To 
assess how the benchmark contributes to 
the environmental objectives, the 
benchmark administrator should disclose 
how the carbon footprint and carbon 
savings of the underlying assets were 
measured, their respective values, 
including the total carbon footprint of the 
benchmark, and the type and source of the 
data used. To enable asset managers to 
choose the most appropriate benchmark for 
their investment strategy, benchmark 
administrators should explain the rationale 
behind the parameters of their 
methodology and explain how the 
benchmark contributes to the 
environmental objectives, including its 
impact on climate-change mitigation. The 
published information should also include 
details on the frequency of reviews and the 
procedure followed.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT 
 
Ten  years  after  the  start  of  the  biggest  financial  crisis  of  the  21th  century,  the  global  and 
European  financial  regulatory  framework  has  altered  dramatically.  The  sector  itself  has 
changed  to  a  limited  extend.  Indeed,  for  example,  in  contrast  to  other  economic  sectors,  a 
substantial  policy debate about  the role of the financial sector in  promoting sustainability in 
light  of the commitments of the Paris Agreement on climate change as implemented in  EU-
legislation  is  a  recent  occurrence.  The  financial  services  sector  has  a  critical  role  to  play  in 
achieving the transition towards a low-carbon economy. This is one of the pre-eminent societal 
challenges of our times. To meet these, a change in culture is needed and it is essential that a 
standardised  European  approach  is  adopted  to  ensure  that  sustainable  finance  becomes  the 
norm.  
 
The Rapporteur welcomes the recommendations put forward by the High Level Expert Group 
on sustainable finance (HLEG), the Commission action plan on sustainable finance as well as 
their recent relevant legislative proposals, as important steps in the right direction. 
 
In addition to the main financial players – such as banks, investment funds, pension funds – 
index  providers,  whose  indexes  alone  help  to  channel  trillions  of  Euros  towards  investment 
projects, have a key role to play. Indeed, financial benchmarks are cornerstones of global capital 
markets  and,  as  stated  by  the  European  Commission,  many  investors  rely  on  financial 
benchmarks, in particular in portfolio allocation and to measure the performance of financial 
products. 
 
At the same time, however, the Rapporteur agrees with the conclusions of the HLEG, which 
state that the current use of benchmarks is a key driver of short-termism in financial markets. 
As  further  highlighted  by  the  HLEG,  the  Rapporteur  believes  that  long-term  risks  and 
opportunities linked to sustainability and climate change are not properly reflected in market 
valuations  and  hence  will  not  be  reflected  in  market  benchmarks.  As  a  result,  investment 
strategies based on traditional benchmarks will tend to follow the status quo and allocate capital 
to assets that are not necessarily aligned with long-term sustainable development objectives. 
 
Sticking  to  the  status  quo  on  the  way  capital  is  allocated  based  on  financial  benchmarks  is 
therefore not an option. 
 
To  address  this  challenge,  and  to  ensure  more  capital  is  channelled  towards  sustainable 
investments, the rapporteur welcomes the efforts undertaken by index providers in developing 
a wide range of indices aimed at capturing sustainability and climate considerations. 
 
Nonetheless, and despite its merits, the added value of these current low-carbon benchmarks is 
rather limited in the sense that these benchmarks often simply discard the most heavily-emitting 
industries (energy utilities, for instance) and merely focus on services or manufacturing with 
limited levels of emissions, rather than focussing on the financing of a new economic model 
compatible  with  the  Paris  Agreement  commitments  as  implemented  in  the  EU  legislation. 
Therefore,  many  of  these  indices  are  viewed  far  from  satisfactory  as  they  are  open  to 
greenwashing and do not always take into account all types of emissions.  
 
It  is  estimated  that  in  the  fields  of  climate  and  energy  space  alone  an  additional  annual 
PR\1164155EN.docx

PE628.440v01-00 
 
EN 
 
investment  of  EUR  180  billion  is  needed  to  meet  the  climate  and  energy  targets  by  2030.  
Against  this  background,  the  rapporteur  agrees  with  the  European  Commission  that  a 
substantial part of this flow will have to come from the private sector and that therefore, in order 
to avoid a fragmented, less effective approach, a European standardised regulatory framework 
is urgently needed. 
 
In  view  of  avoiding  any  form  of  greenwashing,  the  Rapporteur  welcomes  the  proposal  put 
forward  by  the  Commission  as  a  first  step  towards  introducing  minimum  standards  for 
harmonising the methodology applicable to sustainable benchmarks. 
 
However, in order to achieve the objectives set in the Paris Agreement, as implemented in EU 
legislation,  it  is  critical  that  the  European  Parliament  shows  a  significantly  higher  degree  of 
ambition  in  line  with  the  European  Parliament's  own-initiative  report  (INI-report)  on 
sustainable  finance.  This  ambition  should  be  realistic,  flexible  and  open  to  technological 
innovation, and should give at the same time the financial industry clarity and legal certainty 
around the direction of travel. 
 
The Rapporteur proposes the following changes to the Commission proposal: 
 
Firstly,  as  highlighted  by  the  EP  INI-report  on  sustainable  finance  (par27)  all  widely-used 
financial benchmarks do not consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in 
their methodology. Indeed, as confirmed by the Index Industry Association (Survey, 30 June 
2017),  ESG-indexes  represent  only  0.3%  of  the  index  market,  a  very  tiny  niche.  It  is  the 
Rapporteur’s  conviction  that  all  the  elements  of  the  ESG-definition  are  equally  important. 
However, for pragmatic reasons – as measuring the ecological impact of investments is far more 
developed – it is preferable to focus in the first instance on the climate impact of benchmarks, 
and in particular on their alignment with the Paris Agreement commitments as implemented in 
EU legislation. At the same time, the Commission will be empowered to adopt a delegated act 
setting  out  the  methodology  for  measuring  the  social  and  governance  impact  of  financial 
benchmarks. 
 
Despite  several  industry  initiatives  to  take  climate  elements  into  account,  it  appears  that 
traditional  benchmarks  today  provide  investment  paths  closer  to  the  five  degrees  Celsius 
scenario  than  the  two  degree  scenario.  (Mirova  study  ‘Estimating  portfolio  coherence  with 
climate scenario’s’, 2018). It is therefore critical that this proposal does not just focus on a niche 
market,  but  aims  to  bring  the  whole  financial  benchmark  market  in  line  with  the  Paris 
Agreement commitments as implemented in EU legislation.  
 
Therefore, it is the Rapporteur’s belief that by 2022, benchmark providers should have to ensure 
that  all  the  benchmarks  provided  and  published  are  aligned  with  the  Paris  Agreement 
commitments  as  implemented  in  EU  legislation  and  this  according  to  a  standardised 
methodology which will be developed by the Commission in a delegated act published not later 
than two years after the entry into force of this regulation. 
 
The  Rapporteur  proposes,  furthermore,  that  benchmark  providers  describe  precisely  in  a 
standardised way in all the benchmark statements what the climate impact is of the benchmarks 
used and how these are to be aligned with the Paris Agreement commitments as implemented 
in EU legislation.

PR\1164155EN.docx

Secondly, to ensure future consistency and legal certainty, it is imperative that as and when the 
EU taxonomy regulation comes into force, there is coherence between the both texts.  
 
Thirdly,  with  the  rapid  evolution  in  climate  technology  the  Commission  should  investigate 
whether  the  benchmark  sector  is  sufficiently  competitive  and  should  adopt,  if  appropriate, 
measures to boost the competitiveness of the sector. The rapporteur notes that competition could 
be hampered by the high level of fees charged by benchmark providers to their clients. Two 
years  after  the  entry  into  force  of  this  regulation,  the  European  Securities  and  Markets 
Authority, in cooperation with national competent authorities, will produce a report analysing 
whether fees are totally transparent, non-discriminative and based on actual costs. Based on the 
findings of this report, the Commission will be empowered to adopt a delegated act outlining 
criteria  to  ensure  fees  charged  by  benchmark  providers  to  their  clients  for  the  provision  of 
benchmarks are totally transparent, impartial and based on actual costs. 
 
Finally, with the rapid evolution in climate technology it is essential that new innovations are 
integrated by the European Commission. This is the rationale behind having a review clause to 
analyse the impact of this new regulation in terms of making the financial benchmark sector 
aligned  with  the  Paris  agreement  commitments  as  well  as  with  the  requirements  set  in  the 
Regulation  of the European Parliament and the  European Council on the Governance of the 
Energy Union.
